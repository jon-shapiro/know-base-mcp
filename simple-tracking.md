# Simple Work Tracking System

**Purpose**: Jon tells me what we need to do, I track it and remember details
**No Complex Frameworks**: Just natural conversation â†’ automatic documentation

## How It Works

### Jon Says:
- "We need to implement MCP server integration"  
- "We should analyze the cannabis documentation requirements"
- "Let's build the component system"
- "We need to fix the session handoff"

### I Do:
1. **Track the work** in simple format
2. **Remember context** across sessions  
3. **Update status** as we make progress
4. **Verify what actually works** (no fake claims)

## Current Work Items

### Active Work
- **MCP Server Development**: Transform Unity Landing cannabis guides via conversational AI
- **Session Context System**: Reliable session handoff and context preservation  
- **Simple PM System**: Track work without over-engineering

### Completed Work  
- **Repository Setup**: know-base-mcp repository created and organized
- **Context Analysis**: Analyzed previous attempts and learned lessons
- **Initiation System**: Created strategic session initialization process

## Session Integration

### During --initiate:
- Load what we were working on
- **Verify claims intelligently** (test what I say actually works)
- Continue with proven understanding

### During session:
- Track new work as Jon mentions it
- Update progress naturally  
- Remember important decisions and context

### During --end-session:
- Update work status
- Prepare context for next session
- Ensure nothing important is lost

**Key Principle**: Keep it simple, make it work, remember what matters
