## üîç **KEY FINDINGS**

### **Component Reality Check**
- **14 real components** found in Unity Landing vs. 30 original specifications
- **4 universal components** used in all 18 guides (hero, message-box, section-wrapper, help-footer)
- **Specialized sections** exist for complex workflows (site-template, tv-location)

### **Use Case Validation**
- **9 confirmed use cases** based on actual Unity Landing patterns
- **24 advanced use cases** from day-in-life document need validation
- Clear separation between confirmed vs. aspirational capabilities

### **Cannabis Industry Focus**
- Compliance messaging, multi-device content, POS integration confirmed
- Age verification, license display, regulatory requirements identified
- 18 cannabis retail guides provide industry-specific patterns

## üö® **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS**

### **For Human Review**
1. **Read**: [UNITY-LANDING-INDEX-FOR-REVIEW.md](foundation-docs/UNITY-LANDING-INDEX-FOR-REVIEW.md)
2. **Decide**: Which components and use cases for MVP scope
3. **Approve**: Final implementation scope for MCP server

### **Decision Points**
- Component count: 4 universal vs. 7 high-usage vs. 14 all?
- Use case complexity: 9 confirmed vs. selective from 24 advanced?
- Cannabis specialization level needed?
- Implementation approach (pure MCP vs. hybrid)?
