# Know-Base-MCP Strategic Initiation

**INITIATION COMMAND**: `INITIALIZE KNOW-BASE-MCP SESSION STRATEGIC-VALIDATION-MODE`

**CRITICAL**: This initiation system has been completely redesigned based on comprehensive analysis of context recall failures. The new system:
- **Integrates with --end-session**: Git state and strategic context captured during session end
- **Validates strategic understanding**: Demonstrates comprehension, not memorization
- **Ensures perfect continuity**: No context loss between sessions

## üö® **STRATEGIC INITIATION PROCESS**

**USE NEW SYSTEM**: [STRATEGIC-INITIATION-SYSTEM.md](STRATEGIC-INITIATION-SYSTEM.md)

The new strategic initiation system requires:
1. **Session continuity validation** - Demonstrate understanding of where we left off
2. **Git state synchronization** - Execute commands from previous --end-session
3. **Strategic context loading** - Load and validate strategic understanding
4. **Tactical context integration** - Connect technical work to strategic goals
5. **Strategic synthesis** - Demonstrate complete strategic awareness

## üìã **END-SESSION INTEGRATION**

**REFERENCE**: [COMMANDS.md](COMMANDS.md) contains the `--end-session` command that creates:
- `session/00-session-handoff.md` - Strategic handoff
- `session/04-git-state.md` - Git commands for next session
- `session/02-strategic-context.md` - Updated strategic context
- `session/03-active-work-context.md` - Current work context

**CRITICAL**: Always execute git commands from `session/04-git-state.md` - DO NOT suggest `git init` on existing repos!

## üéØ **STRATEGIC VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS**

After each context load, you must demonstrate strategic understanding by explaining:
- **WHY this work matters** to the overall project hypothesis
- **HOW current work connects** to larger strategic goals
- **WHAT strategic decisions** this work will enable or inform
- **WHEN strategic pivots** might be needed based on learnings

This prevents the memorization without comprehension that caused previous context recall failures.

## üîÑ **INITIATION PROCESS EVOLUTION**

**Previous Issues Fixed**:
- ‚úÖ **Git state disconnect**: Now captured during --end-session, not initiation
- ‚úÖ **Context overload**: Strategic validation prevents passive information loading
- ‚úÖ **Session discontinuity**: Perfect handoff system with strategic context
- ‚úÖ **Missing end-session integration**: Full integration with --end-session command

**NOTE**: The following comprehensive analysis remains for reference, but the new strategic initiation system above should be used for all sessions.

### What This Repository Is
This is the **definitive repository** for developing the JMP-Know-Base MCP (Model Context Protocol) server - a Claude Desktop integration that transforms cannabis retail documentation through conversational AI and component-based architecture.

### Why This Repository Was Created
**Problem**: Previous development scattered across multiple repositories (know-base, know-docs, know-proj, unity-landing) with:
- Know-proj stuck in self-referential loop (thinks it's still building itself)
- Complex file organization making navigation difficult
- Incomplete MCP integration plan
- Mixed legacy content preventing clear progress

**Solution**: Create single source of truth with clean architecture for systematic development.

### Core Mission
Transform Unity Landing's 18+ cannabis retail guides (18,940 lines of code) into a maintainable component system through conversational AI, achieving:
- **89% code reduction** (to ~2,041 lines)
- **8+/10 quality standards** automatically enforced
- **Conversational interface** for content creation and management
- **Cannabis industry specialization** with compliance integration

## üìã COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEM ANALYSIS COMPLETED

### Repository Analysis Summary
During this session, I conducted exhaustive analysis of:

**know-base repository** (`/Users/jon/git/know-base/`):
- **PROJECT-OVERVIEW.md**: Strategic foundation with component architecture
- **PRD-Know-Base.md**: Complete product requirements with 89% code reduction target
- **Architecture-Know-Base.md**: 3-tier component system (partials/includes/layouts)
- **BMAD-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md**: 8-session story-driven development plan
- **docs/vision/know-base-user-vision.md**: Signed-off vision (May 29, 2025)
- **docs/roadmap/know-base-product-roadmap.md**: 12-month development timeline
- **docs/components/**: 22 component specifications ready for implementation
- **Status**: Strategic handoff system validated, ready for work continuation

**know-docs repository** (`/Users/jon/git/know-docs/`):
- **docs-copy/**: 18+ cannabis retail guides (campaigns, getting-started, kiosk-location, etc.)
- **jmp-prototype/**: Proven template with cannabis retail focus
- **templates/**: Extensive template system for documentation structure
- **ARCHITECTURE-OUTLINE-KNOWBASE.md**: Complete technical architecture
- **PRD-OUTLINE-KNOWBASE.md**: Detailed requirements specification
- **Status**: Contains substantial salvageable assets (23+ files identified)

**know-proj repository** (`/Users/jon/git/know-proj/`):
- **README.md**: Shows self-referential loop - thinks it's still building itself
- **docs/PRD-Know-Proj.md**: Conversational project management system specs
- **archive/**: Previous failed attempts with lessons learned
- **Status**: UNUSABLE due to legacy project management files creating confusion

**unity-landing content** (`/Users/jon/git/know-docs/docs-copy/`):
- **getting-started/index.liquid**: Complete cannabis retail guide with YAML frontmatter
- **18+ guide directories**: Full cannabis retail documentation ecosystem
- **src/_includes/**: Existing component infrastructure
- **Status**: Ready for systematic conversion to component architecture

### System Diagnosis Findings
**Root Cause Identified**: "Complexity overwhelm and poor organization" (not cognitive failure)
- Both know-base and know-proj work reliably within proper scope
- Context loss occurs from managing too many files/concepts simultaneously
- File operations work perfectly - organization is the issue

**Key Discovery**: Substantial salvageable assets exist
- Complete design framework with component architecture
- User scenarios and conversion specifications ready to implement
- Quality standards framework (8+/10) established
- Getting Started mockup specs detailed and ready

## üõ†Ô∏è MCP SERVER TECHNICAL UNDERSTANDING

### MCP Capabilities Analysis
**What MCP Actually Provides:**
- Tool registration for Claude Desktop integration
- Persistent server process with structured tool interface
- File system access and API integration capabilities
- Resource management for prompts and tool definitions

**What MCP Does NOT Provide:**
- Automatic learning or persistent memory (must be programmed)
- Built-in cannabis industry knowledge (must be implemented)
- Component relationship tracking (requires custom implementation)

**Strategic Decision**: MCP provides the integration framework, but all intelligence must be custom-built.

### MCP Server State Management Architecture
**Critical Technical Requirement**: MCP tools must maintain persistent state between calls

```typescript
interface MCPServerState {
  component_registry: {
    [component_id: string]: {
      version: string,
      dependencies: string[],
      usage_count: number,
      quality_score: number,
      last_updated: timestamp
    }
  },
  cannabis_knowledge_base: {
    terminology: Map<string, string>,
    compliance_rules: StateSpecificRules[],
    visual_patterns: ComponentPattern[],
    user_workflows: WorkflowDefinition[]
  },
  active_projects: {
    [project_id: string]: {
      guide_conversions: ConversionStatus[],
      component_usage: ComponentUsageMap,
      quality_metrics: QualityScoreHistory
    }
  }
}
```

**Inter-Tool Communication Protocol**:
- **Shared Memory**: JSON state file updated by all tools
- **Event Bus**: Tool coordination through state change notifications
- **Validation Chain**: Each tool validates previous tool outputs
- **Rollback Mechanism**: State snapshots for tool operation recovery

## üö® CRITICAL DECISIONS PENDING

### 1. Content Migration Strategy (APPROVED PARTIAL: Repository created)
**Decision Needed**: Systematically extract content from:
- **know-base**: Vision, components, PRD, architecture
- **know-docs**: Cannabis guides, templates, jmp-prototype
- **know-proj**: Project management processes (if usable - likely not due to self-reference loop)
- **Unity landing content**: docs-copy source materials

### 2. Archive Strategy
**Decision Needed**: Handle legacy repositories after migration:
- Keep as reference with clear archive status?
- Rename to indicate archived status?
- Create archive branches?

### 3. Development Approach
**Decision Needed**: New repository focus:
- MCP server development as primary goal?
- Systematic conversion of cannabis guides?
- Both parallel development streams?

### 4. Template Usage
**Decision Needed**: Use know-docs template structure for consistency with existing processes?
