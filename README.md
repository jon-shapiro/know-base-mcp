## 🎯 PROJECT MISSION & GOALS

**Core Objective**: Transform Unity Landing's 18+ cannabis retail guides (18,940 lines) into maintainable component system through conversational AI

**Target Outcomes**:
- **89% code reduction** (to ~2,041 lines) - *Needs validation*
- **8+/10 quality standards** automatically enforced - *Validated in vision doc*
- **Conversational interface** for content creation - *Assumption needs user validation*
- **Cannabis compliance automation** - *🚨 FLAGGED: Likely over-engineered*

**Technology Integration**: 
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol) server** - Core technology confirmed
- **Unity Landing integration** - Needs technical audit
- **Component architecture** - 3-tier system needs validation

**Industry Focus**: 
- **Cannabis retail specialization** - Needs scope validation
- **18+ content management** - Real need confirmed
- **Regulatory compliance** - Scope needs legal validation

## 🚨 PHASE BREAKDOWN & CURRENT STATUS

### PHASE 1: VALIDATION ⚠️ CURRENT PHASE
**Status**: 🔴 **CRITICAL** - Must complete before development  
**Progress**: 70% complete (framework created, awaiting stakeholder review)  
**Blocker**: Your review and approval of validation documents

#### Validation Documents (AWAITING YOUR REVIEW):
- ✅ **[Document Inventory Review](docs/validation/document-inventory-review.md)** - Complete source analysis
- 🔴 **[Use Case Validation](docs/validation/use-case-validation.md)** - Real vs hallucinated requirements
- 🔴 **[Cannabis Compliance Reality Check](docs/validation/cannabis-compliance-validation.md)** - 9-13 week savings potential
- 🔴 **[Gap Analysis](docs/validation/gap-analysis.md)** - Missing requirements identification

#### Project Management Framework (REVIEW OPTIONAL):
- ✅ **[PM Strategy Research](docs/project-management/pm-strategy-research.md)** - Best practices
- ✅ **[Context Management Design](docs/project-management/context-management-design.md)** - Session continuity
- ✅ **[Task Tracking Framework](docs/project-management/task-tracking-design.md)** - Work management

### PHASE 2: USER RESEARCH 🎯 NEXT PHASE
**Status**: ⏸️ **BLOCKED** - Awaiting your authorization  
**Requirements**: 3-5 Unity Landing maintainer interviews  
**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks after authorization  
**Purpose**: Validate all assumptions before development

### PHASE 3: TECHNICAL AUDIT 🔧 PARALLEL TO RESEARCH  
**Status**: ⏸️ **BLOCKED** - Need Unity Landing repo access  
**Requirements**: Repository access for codebase analysis  
**Timeline**: 1 week after access provided  
**Purpose**: Validate technical integration approach

### PHASE 4: DEVELOPMENT 🚀 FUTURE PHASE
**Status**: ⏸️ **BLOCKED** - All above phases must complete first  
**Scope**: TBD based on validation findings  
**Timeline**: TBD based on validated requirements

4. **MVP Scope Definition** - Clear boundaries and limitations

## 🔍 CRITICAL DECISIONS NEEDED FROM YOU

### 1. Cannabis Compliance Scope ⚡ POTENTIAL 9-13 WEEK SAVINGS
- **Question**: What actual cannabis compliance automation is needed vs. what was assumed?
- **Current Analysis**: Detailed multi-state regulatory framework may be hallucinated
- **Options**: 
  - A) Full automation (9-13 weeks) 
  - B) Simple disclaimers (1-2 weeks)
  - C) No automation (0 weeks)
- **Your Decision Needed**: Which option aligns with real needs?

### 2. User Research Authorization 🎯 BLOCKS ALL DEVELOPMENT
- **Requirement**: 3-5 Unity Landing maintainer interviews
- **Purpose**: Validate all assumptions before building
- **Timeline**: Need authorization by Aug 06 to stay on schedule
- **Your Decision Needed**: Approve user research plan?

### 3. Technical Architecture Validation 🏗️ COMPLEXITY QUESTION
- **Question**: 3-tier component system vs. simpler approach?
- **Need**: Unity Landing repository access for technical audit
- **Impact**: Determines entire development approach
- **Your Decision Needed**: Provide repo access for audit?

### 4. MVP Scope Definition 📋 SCOPE CONTROL
- **Question**: Enterprise platform vs. minimal viable product?
- **Current State**: Feature creep identified in analysis
- **Validation Needed**: Define clear boundaries
- **Your Decision Needed**: Approve MVP-first approach?

## ⚡ YOUR IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS

### BY AUGUST 7 (CRITICAL PATH):
- [ ] **Review validation documents** in `docs/validation/` directory
- [ ] **Make scope decision** on cannabis compliance (9-13 week impact)
- [ ] **Authorize user research** (3-5 Unity maintainer interviews)
- [ ] **Provide Unity Landing repo access** for technical audit

### BY AUGUST 10:
- [ ] **Validate compliance requirements** (with legal expert if needed)
- [ ] **Define MVP boundaries** based on validation findings
- [ ] **Approve final project approach** and resource allocation

## 🔄 NEXT SESSION WORKFLOW

**When development resumes**:
1. **AI will test context retention** with 30 diagnostic questions
2. **Process your validation feedback** and update scope
3. **Execute approved user research** plan
4. **Begin technical audit** with repo access
5. **Define final MVP** based on validated requirements

## 📞 STAKEHOLDER & VALIDATION CONTACTS

- **Technical Lead**: Jon (repository owner) - **YOU**
- **Domain Expert**: Cannabis retail operations (TBD - pending validation)
- **End Users**: Unity Landing maintainers (3-5 interviews planned)
- **Legal Validation**: Cannabis compliance expert (if scope approved)

## 🎯 SUCCESS METRICS FOR VALIDATION PHASE

**Validation Complete When**:
- [ ] All assumptions validated or simplified
- [ ] User research completed (3-5 interviews)
- [ ] Technical architecture verified with actual codebase
- [ ] MVP scope clearly defined and approved
- [ ] Cannabis compliance scope validated with evidence

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL REMINDER

**NO DEVELOPMENT WORK** should begin until:
1. ✅ You've reviewed and approved validation documents
2. ✅ User research validates assumptions
3. ✅ Technical audit confirms integration approach
4. ✅ MVP scope is clearly defined with boundaries

**POTENTIAL SAVINGS**: 9-13 weeks if cannabis compliance simplified  
**RISK MITIGATION**: Validation prevents building wrong solution  
**CONTEXT PRESERVATION**: All decisions tracked for future reference
