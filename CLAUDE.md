# Know-Base-MCP Project Memory

## Project Context
**Purpose**: Transform Unity Landing cannabis retail guides through MCP server
**Mission**: 89% code reduction via component architecture + conversational AI
**Status**: VALIDATION PHASE - No development until stakeholder approval

## Critical Information
- **Cannabis compliance**: LIKELY OVER-ENGINEERED - needs validation
- **User research**: REQUIRED before any development begins
- **Technical audit**: Unity Landing integration needs verification
- **Scope risk**: Complex features may be unnecessary

## Key Decisions Made
- Validation-first approach adopted (Aug 04)
- Cannabis compliance flagged as suspect (potential 9-13 week savings)
- Context management system designed to prevent previous failures

## Immediate Priorities
1. Stakeholder review of validation documents (ðŸš¨ 9-13 week savings potential)
2. Stakeholder review of PM system approach and provide feedback
3. User research authorization and execution (3-5 Unity maintainer interviews)
4. Technical audit of Unity Landing system (need repo access)
5. Complete T002: PM System Cleanup Process implementation

## File Locations
- **Validation docs**: `docs/validation/` - ALL require stakeholder review
- **Project management**: `docs/project-management/` - framework designs
- **Session history**: `docs/context/sessions/` - decision history
- **Current status**: `STATUS.md` - real-time project state

## Commands & Workflows
- **Next session prep**: Read `STATUS.md` + latest session file + `pm/registry/active-work.md`
- **File inventory**: Check `docs/files/file-inventory.md`
- **Decision history**: Review `docs/decisions/decision-log.md`
- **PM System**: Load current work from `pm/registry/active-work.md` and update task progress

## PM System Usage
1. **Check active work**: Read pm/registry/active-work.md for current priorities
2. **Review blockers**: Check task files for impediments requiring attention
3. **Update progress**: Modify task status and log work completed
4. **Plan next actions**: Update task plans with next steps and decisions needed
5. **Create new work**: Use templates in pm/templates/ for Epic/Story/Task creation
6. **Track relationships**: Update registries when creating or completing work items

## Critical Success Factors
- NO development without user validation
- Keep scope minimal until proven valuable
- Systematic tracking prevents context loss
- Evidence-based decisions over assumptions
