# Know-Base-MCP Project Memory

## Project Context
**Purpose**: Transform Unity Landing cannabis retail guides through MCP server
**Mission**: 89% code reduction via component architecture + conversational AI
**Status**: VALIDATION PHASE - No development until stakeholder approval

## Critical Information
- **Cannabis compliance**: LIKELY OVER-ENGINEERED - needs validation
- **User research**: REQUIRED before any development begins
- **Technical audit**: Unity Landing integration needs verification
- **Scope risk**: Complex features may be unnecessary

## Key Decisions Made
- Validation-first approach adopted (Aug 04)
- Cannabis compliance flagged as suspect (potential 9-13 week savings)
- Context management system designed to prevent previous failures

## Immediate Priorities
1. Stakeholder review of validation documents
2. User research authorization and execution
3. Technical audit of Unity Landing system
4. Scope validation and MVP definition

## File Locations
- **Validation docs**: `docs/validation/` - ALL require stakeholder review
- **Project management**: `docs/project-management/` - framework designs
- **Session history**: `docs/context/sessions/` - decision history
- **Current status**: `STATUS.md` - real-time project state

## Commands & Workflows
- **Next session prep**: Read `STATUS.md` + latest session file
- **File inventory**: Check `docs/files/file-inventory.md`
- **Decision history**: Review `docs/decisions/decision-log.md`

## Critical Success Factors
- NO development without user validation
- Keep scope minimal until proven valuable
- Systematic tracking prevents context loss
- Evidence-based decisions over assumptions
