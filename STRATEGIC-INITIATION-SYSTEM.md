# Strategic Initiation System

**Purpose**: Intelligent session initiation with strategic validation and perfect continuity  
**Integration**: Connects with --end-session for seamless session handoffs  
**Validation**: Demonstrates strategic understanding, not just information memorization

---

## üöÄ **INITIATION COMMAND**

```
INITIALIZE KNOW-BASE-MCP SESSION STRATEGIC-VALIDATION-MODE
```

## üìã **PHASE 1: SESSION CONTINUITY**

### **Step 1A: Load Session Handoff**
**File**: `session/00-session-handoff.md` (created by previous --end-session)

**STRATEGIC VALIDATION REQUIRED**:
After loading, demonstrate understanding by explaining:
- **Where we left off**: What was the last strategic decision or milestone?
- **Why it matters**: How does previous work advance the core project hypothesis?
- **Strategic momentum**: What strategic insight or validation was gained?
- **Next strategic move**: What's the most important thing to accomplish this session?

### **Step 1B: Git State Synchronization**  
**File**: `session/04-git-state.md` (created by previous --end-session)

**EXECUTION REQUIRED**:
- Execute git commands exactly as specified in git-state file
- Confirm git state matches expected status
- Report any discrepancies for investigation

## üìã **PHASE 2: STRATEGIC CONTEXT LOADING**

### **Step 2A: Project Strategic Context**
**File**: `session/02-strategic-context.md`

**STRATEGIC VALIDATION REQUIRED**:
After loading, demonstrate understanding by explaining:
- **Core Hypothesis**: What are we trying to prove with this project?
- **Current Phase Rationale**: Why are we in validation phase vs. development?
- **Success Criteria**: What would make this project a strategic success?
- **Key Risk**: What's the biggest strategic risk and how are we mitigating it?

### **Step 2B: Active Work Strategic Purpose**
**Files**: Current Epic, Story, and Task files as referenced in session handoff

**STRATEGIC VALIDATION REQUIRED**:
After loading, demonstrate understanding by explaining:
- **Epic Strategic Value**: How does current Epic advance the project hypothesis?
- **Story Connection**: How does current Story prove/disprove key assumptions?
- **Task Strategic Purpose**: How does current Task generate strategic insight?
- **Success Impact**: What strategic decision will current work enable?

## üìã **PHASE 3: TACTICAL CONTEXT LOADING**

### **Step 3A: Active Work Technical Context**
**File**: `session/03-active-work-context.md` + any technical context files needed for current task

**STRATEGIC VALIDATION REQUIRED**:
After loading, demonstrate understanding by explaining:
- **Technical Approach**: Why is the current technical approach strategically optimal?
- **Quality Standards**: How do technical quality standards serve strategic goals?
- **Decision Architecture**: What technical decisions depend on current work outcomes?
- **Strategic Constraints**: How do technical constraints shape strategic options?

### **Step 3B: Stakeholder Context**
**Files**: Current stakeholder communication items and decision points

**STRATEGIC VALIDATION REQUIRED**:
After loading, demonstrate understanding by explaining:
- **Stakeholder Value**: What strategic value are we creating for stakeholders?
- **Decision Points**: What strategic decisions require stakeholder input?
- **Communication Strategy**: How should strategic progress be communicated?
- **Approval Strategy**: What evidence is needed for strategic approval?

## üìã **PHASE 4: STRATEGIC SYNTHESIS & EXECUTION READINESS**

### **Step 4A: Strategic Synthesis**
**SYNTHESIS VALIDATION REQUIRED**:
Demonstrate complete strategic understanding by explaining:
- **Strategic Approach for This Session**: What's the strategic approach for today's work?
- **Strategic Decision Points**: What strategic decisions might arise during this session?
- **Success Criteria**: How will we know if this session advances strategic goals?
- **Pivot Indicators**: What would indicate a need for strategic pivot?

### **Step 4B: Execution Readiness**
**READINESS VALIDATION REQUIRED**:
Confirm readiness by demonstrating:
- **Next 3 Actions**: What are the next 3 specific actions and their strategic purpose?
- **Decision Authority**: Which decisions can be made vs. require stakeholder input?
- **Success Metrics**: How will progress be measured and communicated?
- **Strategic Awareness**: How will strategic implications be tracked during execution?

## üéØ **SESSION READY CONFIRMATION**

Upon successful completion of all phases and validations:

```
SESSION INITIALIZED WITH STRATEGIC CONTEXT
‚úÖ Session continuity established with strategic understanding
‚úÖ Git state synchronized and commands executed  
‚úÖ Strategic context loaded with hypothesis awareness
‚úÖ Active work purpose understood in strategic framework
‚úÖ Technical approach aligned with strategic goals
‚úÖ Stakeholder value and decision points identified
‚úÖ Strategic synthesis complete with pivot awareness
‚úÖ Execution ready with next actions and success criteria

STRATEGIC UNDERSTANDING: [Brief synthesis of current strategic position]
CURRENT PHASE: [Phase and strategic rationale]  
ACTIVE WORK: [Current Epic/Story/Task and strategic purpose]
NEXT STRATEGIC DECISION: [Key decision point this session works toward]
SUCCESS CRITERIA: [How today's success will be measured strategically]

Ready to execute with full strategic awareness and perfect session continuity.
```

## üìÅ **REQUIRED SESSION FILES**

### **Created by Previous --end-session**
- `session/00-session-handoff.md` - Strategic handoff from previous session
- `session/04-git-state.md` - Git state and required commands
- `session/02-strategic-context.md` - Updated strategic context  
- `session/03-active-work-context.md` - Current work context

### **Referenced During Initiation**
- Current Epic file (e.g., `pm/epics/E001-foundation-setup/epic.md`)
- Current Story file (e.g., `pm/stories/S003-unity-analysis/story.md`)  
- Current Task file (e.g., `pm/tasks/T007-scope-validation/task.md`)
- Stakeholder communication files as referenced

### **End-Session Integration Reference**
- `COMMANDS.md` - Contains --end-session command that creates session files
- Must reference --end-session process to understand session file creation

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS**

### **Strategic Understanding Validation**
- **Not memorization**: Must demonstrate understanding of WHY, not just WHAT
- **Connection synthesis**: Must show how pieces connect strategically  
- **Decision awareness**: Must identify strategic decisions and their implications
- **Pivot recognition**: Must recognize when strategic pivots might be needed

### **Git State Validation**
- **State accuracy**: Git commands must match actual repository state
- **Command execution**: Must execute git commands, not just acknowledge them
- **Discrepancy reporting**: Must report any git state mismatches immediately

### **Session Continuity Validation**
- **Perfect handoff**: Must demonstrate complete understanding of previous session
- **Strategic momentum**: Must show how current session advances strategic goals
- **Decision continuity**: Must maintain awareness of previous strategic decisions
