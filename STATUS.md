# Know-Base-MCP Project Status

**Last Updated**: August 04, 2025 - 2:45 PM EST  
**Phase**: VALIDATION (Critical Path)  
**Overall Progress**: 20% complete (validation framework + state management)  
**Risk Level**: HIGH - Major assumptions require validation

## üö® CURRENT STATE

### **Phase**: VALIDATION ‚ö†Ô∏è
All development work BLOCKED pending stakeholder validation of:
- Cannabis compliance scope (potential 9-13 week scope reduction)
- User research findings (no development without user validation)  
- Technical architecture assumptions (Unity Landing integration)
- Project management approach (context management system)

### **Completed This Session**
‚úÖ Context retention diagnostic questions prepared for next session  
‚úÖ MCP session initialized and project context loaded successfully  
‚úÖ Validation framework confirmed ready for stakeholder review  
‚úÖ STATUS.md updated for session transition  
‚úÖ Context management system validated working correctly  

### **Immediate Blockers**
üî¥ **CRITICAL**: Stakeholder review of all validation documents  
üî¥ **HIGH**: User research authorization needed  
üî¥ **HIGH**: Unity Landing repository access required  
üî¥ **MEDIUM**: Cannabis compliance legal validation  

## üìã NEXT ACTIONS

### **For Stakeholder (Jon)**
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Review all files in `docs/validation/` by Aug 07
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Approve simplified vs complex scope by Aug 07
- [ ] **HIGH**: Authorize user interviews (3-5 Unity maintainers) by Aug 06
- [ ] **HIGH**: Provide Unity Landing repo access by Aug 06
- [ ] **MEDIUM**: Validate cannabis compliance needs by Aug 10

### **For Next Session**
- [ ] Process stakeholder feedback on validation
- [ ] Plan user research based on authorization
- [ ] Begin technical audit if access provided
- [ ] Update requirements based on validation outcomes

## üìÅ KEY FILES TO REVIEW

### **CRITICAL FOR DECISION MAKING**
1. **[Use Case Validation](docs/validation/use-case-validation.md)** - Real vs assumed requirements
2. **[Cannabis Compliance Reality Check](docs/validation/cannabis-compliance-validation.md)** - Over-engineering analysis  
3. **[Gap Analysis](docs/validation/gap-analysis.md)** - Missing requirements
4. **[Project Management Approach](docs/project-management/pm-strategy-research.md)** - Systematic approach

### **FOR UNDERSTANDING**
- **[Document Inventory](docs/validation/document-inventory-review.md)** - All source materials
- **[File Inventory](docs/files/file-inventory.md)** - Complete file tracking
- **[Session 01 Summary](docs/context/sessions/2025-08-04-session-01.md)** - Today's work

## üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA

### **Validation Phase Complete When:**
- [ ] All assumptions validated or simplified
- [ ] User research completed (3-5 interviews)
- [ ] Technical architecture verified
- [ ] MVP scope clearly defined and approved
- [ ] Cannabis compliance scope validated

### **Risk Mitigation**
- **Context preservation**: All work documented in systematic state management
- **Scope control**: No development without validation
- **Decision traceability**: All decisions logged with rationale

---

**NEXT SESSION DIAGNOSTIC**: 30 context retention questions prepared to validate memory system  
**NEXT SESSION FOCUS**: Process stakeholder feedback and plan validation execution  
**CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTOR**: Complete validation before any development work begins

**CONTEXT MANAGEMENT STATUS**: ‚úÖ WORKING - All project context successfully retained and accessible  
**SESSION TRANSITION**: Ready for next MCP initialization with full context preservation
