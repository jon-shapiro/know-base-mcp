# Know-Base-MCP Project Status

**Last Updated**: August 04, 2025 - 6:30 PM EST  
**Phase**: VALIDATION (Critical Path)  
**Overall Progress**: 25% complete (validation framework + operational PM system)  
**Risk Level**: HIGH - Major assumptions require validation

## üö® OUTSTANDING STAKEHOLDER REVIEW ITEMS

### üî• CRITICAL ACTIONS REQUIRED FROM JON:
1. **üö® URGENT**: Review [Cannabis Compliance Reality Check](docs/validation/cannabis-compliance-validation.md) - **9-13 week savings potential**
2. **üö® URGENT**: Review [Use Case Validation](docs/validation/use-case-validation.md) - Real vs assumed requirements
3. **üö® URGENT**: Authorize user research (3-5 Unity maintainer interviews) by Aug 06
4. **üö® URGENT**: Provide Unity Landing repository access for technical audit
5. **üìã HIGH**: Review new [PM System](pm/README.md) and provide feedback on approach

## üö® CURRENT STATE

### **Phase**: VALIDATION ‚ö†Ô∏è
All development work BLOCKED pending stakeholder validation of:
- Cannabis compliance scope (potential 9-13 week scope reduction)
- User research findings (no development without user validation)  
- Technical architecture assumptions (Unity Landing integration)
- Project management approach (context management system)

### **Completed This Session**
‚úÖ Complete PM system implemented with Epic/Story/Task hierarchy  
‚úÖ Working templates for all PM artifacts (Epic/Story/Task/Analysis/Plan)  
‚úÖ Registry system operational with active work tracking  
‚úÖ PM system integration with AI session initialization  
‚úÖ All documentation updated with current project state and action items  
‚úÖ Task T001 (PM Requirements Analysis) completed successfully  

### **Immediate Blockers**
üî¥ **CRITICAL**: Stakeholder review of all validation documents  
üî¥ **HIGH**: User research authorization needed  
üî¥ **HIGH**: Unity Landing repository access required  
üî¥ **MEDIUM**: Cannabis compliance legal validation  

## üìã NEXT ACTIONS

### **For Stakeholder (Jon)**
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Review all files in `docs/validation/` by Aug 07
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Approve simplified vs complex scope by Aug 07
- [ ] **HIGH**: Authorize user interviews (3-5 Unity maintainers) by Aug 06
- [ ] **HIGH**: Provide Unity Landing repo access by Aug 06
- [ ] **MEDIUM**: Validate cannabis compliance needs by Aug 10

### **For Next Session**
- [ ] Process stakeholder feedback on validation documents
- [ ] Process stakeholder feedback on PM system approach
- [ ] Plan user research based on authorization
- [ ] Begin technical audit if access provided
- [ ] Update requirements based on validation outcomes
- [ ] Complete T002: PM System Cleanup Process

## üìã CURRENT ACTIVE WORK

### **Epic E001: Project Management System** - 60% complete
- **Story S001**: Create PM Capabilities - 80% complete
