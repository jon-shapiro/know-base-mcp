## ðŸ”„ AUTOMATED COURSE CORRECTION SYSTEM

const interventionFramework = {
  warningLevel: {
    detection: "Automated metric threshold breach",
    response: [
      "Send notification to development team",
      "Log warning in project dashboard", 
      "Schedule review meeting within 48 hours",
      "Begin trend analysis and prediction"
    ],
    escalation_condition: "Warning persists > defined escalation_time"
  },
  
  criticalLevel: {
    detection: "Critical threshold breach or warning escalation",
    response: [
      "Immediate notification to all stakeholders",
      "Halt potentially problematic work streams",
      "Initiate emergency assessment protocol",
      "Implement temporary mitigation measures"
    ],

    detection: "Critical escalation or system failure",
    response: [
      "Full work stoppage on affected components",
      "Emergency stakeholder meeting within 4 hours",

    measurement: "Time between warning trigger and actual impact",
    success_threshold: "80% of issues detected early"
  },
  
  falsePositiveRate: {
    target: "< 15% false positive warning rate",
    measurement: "Warnings that don't lead to actual issues",
    adjustment_mechanism: "Machine learning model refinement"
  },
  
  courseCorrection: {
    target: "90% of warnings resolved within escalation timeframe",
    measurement: "Warning resolution time vs. defined thresholds",
    improvement_process: "Intervention effectiveness analysis"
  }
}
