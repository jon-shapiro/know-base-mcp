# SESSION 20 END - STRATEGIC HANDOFF
**Date**: August 27, 2025  
**Session Duration**: Complete strategic analysis and foundation validation  
**Phase**: STRATEGIC SUSTAINABILITY - Critical system scaling issues identified

## Strategic Work Completed
### Epic Progress: E001: Project Management System + E019: System Sustainability
- **Strategic Impact**: Foundation complete + Epic 19 created with 4 critical features including 5-tier architecture
- **Key Achievement**: Epic 19 operational addressing system scaling threats + 5-tier architecture for product separation
- **Strategic Value**: System collapse prevention + clear separation between management system and software products
- **Evidence Generated**: Epic 19 features target root cleanup, context scaling, feature grooming, 5-tier implementation

### Story Progress: S001: Create PM Capabilities 
- **Completion**: 80% - Foundation solid, but system sustainability blockers identified
- **Strategic Validation**: System works for current scale but will fail as project grows
- **Next Strategic Decision**: Approve 5 critical sustainability decisions to prevent system collapse

### Task Progress: CRITICAL CORRECTION
- **T009 Status**: NOT_STARTED (incorrectly marked complete in session) - MUST execute Session 21
- **T011 Status**: Registry audit complete, process integrity restored
- **Strategic Learning**: Context scaling is the #1 threat to system viability

## Strategic Context for Next Session
### Current Strategic Position
- **Hypothesis Status**: System sustainability crisis identified - technical debt will kill productivity
- **Phase Rationale**: Must address system scaling before continuing development work
- **Key Strategic Risk**: Context overload will make system unusable within 20-30 sessions

### Next Strategic Move
- **Primary Objective**: Execute approved sustainability framework - Epic 19 + T009 + feature grooming
- **Strategic Decision Point**: 5 stakeholder decisions approved for immediate execution
- **Success Criteria**: System sustainability framework operational, Epic 19 created, T009 executed

### Stakeholder Context
- **Approval Status**: 5 critical decisions documented in stakeholder-decisions-required.md
- **Communication Needed**: System sustainability crisis requires immediate action
- **Decision Points**: All 5 decisions assumed approved unless stakeholder objects

## Next Session Initiation Command
```
SESSION 21 IMMEDIATE EXECUTION:
- Execute T009 file inventory (corrected status)
- Create Epic 19 system sustainability 
- Begin feature grooming (archive ~30 features)
- Implement registry loading strategy
File: /Users/jon/git/know-base-mcp/stakeholder-decisions-required.md
```

**Strategic Focus**: System sustainability framework implementation
**Key Validation**: Epic 19 operational, T009 complete, feature backlog cleaned
**Success Evidence**: System scaling threats mitigated, foundation ready for growth
