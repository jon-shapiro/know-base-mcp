# Session Strategic Handoff
**Date**: August 06, 2025
**Session Duration**: Repository Separation Planning + Registry Enhancement COMPLETE  
**Phase**: READY FOR FILE INVENTORY REVIEW - Organized system with separation plan

## Strategic Work Completed
### Epic Progress: E001: Project Management System
- **Strategic Impact**: Enhanced PM system with comprehensive registry tracking and repository separation planning
- **Key Achievement**: Created three-system architecture preventing PM/project file confusion while enabling reusable PM capabilities
- **Strategic Value**: Repository separation plan enables focused cannabis guide development with clean reusable PM system
- **Evidence Generated**: Comprehensive separation plan + enhanced registry system with Epic→Story→Task→Analysis/Plan linking

### Story Progress: S001: Create PM Capabilities 
- **Completion**: 95% - Enhanced registry system with plans/analysis tracking, separation planning complete
- **Strategic Validation**: Repository separation prevents organizational confusion while maintaining systematic PM capabilities
- **Next Strategic Decision**: Execute T009 file inventory review with separation-aware context for clean migration

### Task Progress: T009: File Inventory Review with Enhanced Context
- **Status**: CREATED with comprehensive context including repository separation planning
- **Strategic Learning**: Components are process testing tools, not scope decisions - changes entire project approach
- **Quality**: Task includes all strategic clarifications and separation context for systematic file review
- **Critical Achievement**: Enhanced file creation process ensures automatic registry updates and linking

## Strategic Context for Next Session
### Current Strategic Position
- **Hypothesis Status**: Repository separation plan addresses organizational confusion while maintaining PM capabilities
- **Phase Rationale**: File inventory review with separation context enables clean focused repository creation
- **Key Strategic Risk**: Must maintain systematic organization discipline during repository separation execution

### Next Strategic Move

- **Strategic Decision Point**: File categorization for clean repository migration (PM vs. cannabis vs. runtime)
- **Success Criteria**: Enhanced file inventory enabling systematic migration to clean focused repositories

### Stakeholder Context
- **Approval Status**: Repository separation plan ready for approval - addresses PM/project confusion systematically
- **Communication Needed**: Three-system architecture with demo/production separation for jmp-content
- **Decision Points**: Approve separation plan and begin T009 execution with enhanced context
