# Session Work Classification Log
**Date**: August 05, 2025  
**Session Type**: Strategic Validation + Simple Operational Rules Implementation

## ðŸ“Š **SESSION WORK CLASSIFICATION**

### **Work Items Completed:**

#### **Session-Only Work (Per Rule 1: <1 hour, single session)**
- Strategic initiation validation and testing
- Components 0A+0B validation testing (proving they don't actually work)
- Documentation updates and README revision
- Command integration fixes
- Session context file updates

**Total Session-Only Time**: ~3 hours  
**Classification Rationale**: Administrative and validation work, single session completion

#### **Task Work (Per Rule 1: >1 hour, multi-session, deliverables)**
- **T002: PM System Operational Gaps Analysis** â†’ **STATUS CHANGE: COMPLETE**
- **Deliverable Created**: `pm/operational-rules.md` - Simple operational rules framework
- **Analysis Complete**: All identified PM gaps addressed with simple rules approach
- **Duration**: Multi-session work spanning analysis and implementation phases

### **Index Maintenance Applied (Rule 2)**
- âœ… Updated `pm/PM-ARTIFACT-INDEX.md` with T002 completion status
- âœ… Updated T002 artifacts list to include operational-rules.md
- âœ… Updated progress tracking and next actions
- âœ… Validated index consistency with file system

### **Cleanup Actions Applied (Rule 3)**
- Session files organized and updated
- Old session context replaced with current status
- Strategic handoff prepared for next session
- No archival needed (no work >30 days old)

### **Command Integration Status (Rule 4)**
- âœ… Updated COMMANDS.md with operational rules integration
- âœ… Updated STRATEGIC-INITIATION-SYSTEM.md to include operational-rules.md
- âœ… Enhanced --update-docs and --end-session commands
- âœ… Session management commands operational

## ðŸŽ¯ **STRATEGIC OUTCOMES**

### **Key Achievement**
Simple operational rules successfully implemented, solving the real PM problems identified without over-engineering.

### **Strategic Validation**
PM system now operational and ready to support user guide development work with systematic tracking and maintenance.

### **Ready for Next Session**
- Clear operational rules in place
- PM system supporting real work
- Session context integrity maintained
- Focus ready for user guide requirements and MCP tool development
