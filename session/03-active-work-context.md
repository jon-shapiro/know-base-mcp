# Active Work Context
**Last Updated**: August 06, 2025
**Current Epic**: E001: Project Management System
**Current Story**: S001: Create PM Capabilities  
**Current Task**: T009: File Inventory Review with Enhanced Context

## Epic Strategic Context
### Epic Purpose: E001: Project Management System
**Strategic Value**: Enhanced PM system with repository separation preventing organizational confusion while enabling reusable capabilities
**Success Criteria**: Complete PM system with three-system architecture and enhanced registry tracking
**Strategic Risk**: Must maintain systematic organization during repository separation execution
**Timeline**: Enhanced PM system ready for extraction to clean know-docs repository

### Epic Progress
- **Completion**: 95%
- **Stories Complete**: 1 of 1 (S001 nearly complete with enhanced registry system)
- **Strategic Insights**: Repository separation essential to prevent PM/project file confusion
- **Next Strategic Milestone**: Clean repository migration with focused system boundaries

## Story Strategic Context  
### Story Purpose: S001: Create PM Capabilities (95% COMPLETE)
**Strategic Value**: Enhanced PM system with comprehensive registry tracking and repository separation planning
**Hypothesis Test**: Testing whether systematic PM with clear separation enables focused development work
**Evidence Goal**: Demonstrate that organized PM system supports clean project development without confusion
**Strategic Connection**: Enhanced PM capabilities enable systematic cannabis guide development with reusable PM foundation

### Story Progress
- **Completion**: 95% 
- **Tasks Complete**: T001 (PM Requirements Analysis) complete; T009 (File Inventory Review) ready for execution
- **Key Insights**: Repository separation plan addresses organizational confusion while maintaining PM capabilities
- **Next Decision**: Execute T009 for systematic file categorization enabling clean repository migration

## Task Strategic Context
### Task Purpose: T009: File Inventory Review with Enhanced Context
**Strategic Value**: Systematic file categorization for clean repository separation enabling focused development without confusion
**Quality Standard**: Enhanced context annotations with repository separation awareness and process testing workflow focus
**Evidence Generation**: File categorization plan enabling clean migration to focused repositories (PM vs. cannabis vs. runtime)
**Decision Support**: Confirms which files support process testing workflow vs. which are over-engineered assumptions

### Task Progress
- **Status**: NOT_STARTED - Created with comprehensive context including strategic clarifications and separation planning
- **Next Actions**: 
  1. Review all files with separation context (PM vs. cannabis generator vs. runtime output)
  2. Annotate files with process testing workflow roles and validation requirements
  3. Make usage decisions for clean repository migration (use, validate, archive)
  4. Identify gaps in process testing file coverage for complete workflow support
- **Success Criteria**: Enhanced file inventory enabling systematic migration to clean focused repositories
- **Completion Timeline**: Next session for systematic file review with separation awareness

## Technical Context (Strategic Framework)
### Technical Approach
**Strategic Rationale**: Repository separation with enhanced registries ensures clean focused development while maintaining systematic PM capabilities
**Quality Alignment**: Enhanced file creation process with automatic registry updates ensures systematic organization preventing confusion
**Decision Architecture**: File categorization enables clean repository migration decisions for focused development

### Cannabis Industry Context
**Product Focus**: know-base-mcp becomes JMP-specific cannabis guide generator with company-specific customization (cannabis/jmp/)
**Industry Value**: Product-specific architecture demonstrates understanding of cannabis company customization requirements
**Specialization**: Demo/production separation for jmp-content enables professional stakeholder demonstrations + easy production integration

## Next Session Strategic Focus
**Primary Objective**: Execute T009 file inventory review with repository separation context for clean migration planning
**Strategic Decision**: Categorize files for clean focused repository creation (PM system vs. cannabis generator vs. runtime output)
**Evidence Goal**: Enhanced file inventory with separation-aware annotations enabling systematic clean repository migration
**Success Measure**: File categorization plan ready for creating clean focused repositories without organizational confusion
