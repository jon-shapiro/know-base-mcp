# Active Work Context
**Last Updated**: August 06, 2025
**Current Epic**: E001: Project Management System
**Current Story**: S001: Create PM Capabilities  
**Current Tasks**: T009: File Inventory Review + T011: Process Failure Correction

## Epic Strategic Context
### Epic Purpose: E001: Project Management System
**Strategic Value**: Enhanced PM system with repository separation preventing organizational confusion while enabling reusable capabilities
**Success Criteria**: Complete PM system with three-system architecture, validated registries, and comprehensive gap analysis
**Strategic Risk**: Must execute T009 file inventory + T011 process audit to maintain systematic organization
**Timeline**: Enhanced PM system with validated registries ready for clean repository migration

### Epic Progress
- **Completion**: 90% (corrected from 95%)
- **Stories Complete**: 1 of 1 (S001 at 80% with validated registry foundation)
- **Strategic Insights**: Registry validation revealed 75% underestimation of requirements phase scope
- **Next Strategic Milestone**: T009 file inventory + T011 process audit for complete foundation validation

## Story Strategic Context  
### Story Purpose: S001: Create PM Capabilities (80% COMPLETE)
**Strategic Value**: Enhanced PM system with comprehensive registry validation and gap analysis preventing requirements phase scope errors
**Hypothesis Test**: Testing whether validated registry system with gap analysis enables accurate requirements phase planning
**Evidence Goal**: Demonstrate that comprehensive registry validation supports systematic development planning without scope errors
**Strategic Connection**: Validated PM capabilities with gap analysis enable accurate cannabis guide development planning

### Story Progress
- **Completion**: 80% (corrected from 85%)
- **Tasks Complete**: T010 (Document Consolidation); T001 (REVIEW); T009, T011, T002 (NOT_STARTED)
- **Key Insights**: Registry validation shows 9 additional use cases + 30 hours consolidation work requiring requirements phase adjustment
- **Next Decision**: Execute T009 file inventory + T011 process audit with validated registry foundation

## Task Strategic Context
### Task Purpose: T009: File Inventory Review + T011: Process Failure Correction
**Strategic Value**: Systematic file categorization + process audit for clean repository separation with process integrity
**Quality Standard**: Enhanced context annotations with repository separation awareness and validated registry foundation
**Evidence Generation**: File categorization plan + process audit enabling clean migration to focused repositories
**Decision Support**: Confirms file organization for systematic repository separation with process failure prevention

### Task Progress
- **Status**: NOT_STARTED - Ready for execution with validated registry foundation and comprehensive gap context
- **Next Actions**: 
  1. Execute T009: Review all files with separation context and enhanced annotations
  2. Execute T011: Systematic registry audit and process failure prevention strengthening
  3. Validate file categorization for clean repository migration
  4. Complete process integrity validation for systematic development
- **Success Criteria**: Enhanced file inventory + process audit completion enabling systematic clean repository migration
- **Completion Timeline**: Next session for T009 + T011 execution with validated registry foundation

## Technical Context (Strategic Framework)
### Technical Approach
**Strategic Rationale**: Registry validation with gap analysis ensures accurate requirements phase planning while process audit prevents future failures
**Quality Alignment**: Comprehensive registry validation enables systematic development approach with accurate scope and effort estimation
**Decision Architecture**: File inventory + process audit enables clean repository migration with validated systematic process

### Cannabis Industry Context
**Product Focus**: know-base-mcp becomes JMP-specific cannabis guide generator with validated use case coverage
**Industry Value**: Comprehensive use case coverage (21 vs 12) demonstrates complete cannabis workflow understanding
**Specialization**: Registry validation enables accurate cannabis industry customization requirements

## Next Session Strategic Focus
**Primary Objective**: Execute T009 file inventory review + T011 process audit with validated comprehensive registry foundation
**Strategic Decision**: File categorization + process validation for clean focused repository creation
**Evidence Goal**: Enhanced file inventory + process audit enabling systematic clean repository migration with process integrity
**Success Measure**: File categorization plan + process validation ready for creating clean focused repositories without organizational confusion or process failures
