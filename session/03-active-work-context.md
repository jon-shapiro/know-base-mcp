# Active Work Context
**Last Updated**: August 27, 2025  
**Current Epic**: E001 - Project Management System (80% complete)  
**Next Epic**: E019 - Strategic Context & Process Management System (to be created)  
**Critical Priority**: System sustainability framework implementation

## Epic Strategic Context
### Epic Purpose: E001 - Project Management System
**Strategic Value**: Foundation complete, sustainability threats identified
**Success Criteria**: System operational but scaling threats require immediate attention
**Strategic Risk**: Context overload and process failures will break system
**Timeline**: Foundation complete, sustainability work begins Session 21

### Epic Progress
- **Completion**: 80% (foundation solid)
- **Stories Complete**: S001 nearly complete
- **Strategic Insights**: System works at current scale but will fail as it grows
- **Next Strategic Milestone**: System sustainability framework operational

## Story Strategic Context  
### Story Purpose: S001 - Create PM Capabilities
**Strategic Value**: PM system operational, sustainability gaps identified
**Hypothesis Test**: Can PM system scale with project growth?
**Evidence Goal**: System sustainability framework prevents scaling failures
**Strategic Connection**: Foundation for all other strategic work

### Story Progress
- **Completion**: 80% (4 of 5 tasks complete)
- **Tasks Complete**: T010, T011, T001 (review), T002 (remaining)
- **CRITICAL CORRECTION**: T009 NOT complete - must execute Session 21
- **Next Decision**: Execute system sustainability framework

## Task Strategic Context
### IMMEDIATE PRIORITY: T009 - File Inventory Review
**Strategic Value**: Foundation for repository migration and MCP design
**Quality Standard**: Enhanced context annotations for process testing workflow
**Evidence Generation**: Complete file inventory with usage decisions
**Decision Support**: Repository migration strategy and MCP construct design

### Task Progress
- **Status**: NOT_STARTED (corrected from false completion claim)
- **Next Actions**: Execute complete file inventory with process testing context
- **Success Criteria**: Enhanced file inventory enables repository migration
- **Completion Timeline**: Session 21 priority execution

## System Sustainability Context (NEW PRIORITY)
### Critical System Threats Identified
**Context Overload**: System will fail within 20-30 sessions due to context size
**Registry Drift**: Registries becoming fiction, strategic decisions on false data
**Process Failures**: Hidden failure modes will corrupt system state
**Feature Bloat**: 30-40% of features are duplicates/over-engineered

### System Sustainability Framework Required
1. **Epic 19 Creation** - Dedicated epic for system sustainability
2. **Registry Loading Strategy** - Smart context loading by project phase
3. **Feature Grooming** - Archive problematic features for cleaner backlog
4. **Project Inception Process** - Clear criteria for repository migration
5. **Context Scaling Solution** - Prevent context death spiral

## Next Session Strategic Focus
**Primary Objective**: Execute system sustainability framework implementation
**Strategic Decision**: 5 stakeholder decisions assumed approved
**Evidence Goal**: Epic 19 operational, T009 complete, feature backlog cleaned
**Success Measure**: System scaling threats mitigated, sustainable foundation established

## Session 21 Execution Plan
1. **Execute T009** - Complete file inventory with enhanced context
2. **Create Epic 19** - System sustainability epic with 7 features  
3. **Begin Feature Grooming** - Identify and archive problematic features
4. **Implement Registry Loading** - Smart context loading strategy
5. **Document Project Inception** - Repository migration criteria and process

**Critical Success Factor**: System sustainability framework operational by end of Session 21
