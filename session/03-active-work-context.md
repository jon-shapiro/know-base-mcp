# Active Work Context
**Last Updated**: August 04, 2025
**Current Epic**: E001: Foundation Validation
**Current Story**: S003: Unity Landing Analysis  
**Current Task**: T008: Strategic Initiation Testing (NEXT)

## Epic Strategic Context
### Epic Purpose: E001: Foundation Validation
**Strategic Value**: Ensure we build the right solution by validating assumptions and preventing over-engineering
**Success Criteria**: Reliable session management, validated scope, stakeholder approval for development phase
**Strategic Risk**: Building wrong solution due to unvalidated assumptions or poor session continuity
**Timeline**: Validation phase completion depends on strategic system testing and stakeholder scope review

### Epic Progress
- **Completion**: 75%
- **Stories Complete**: 2 of 3 (Strategic initiation system, Unity analysis complete; Testing pending)
- **Strategic Insights**: Context recall failures were organizational, not AI limitations; Strategic validation prevents memorization
- **Next Strategic Milestone**: Successful strategic initiation system testing

## Story Strategic Context  
### Story Purpose: S003: Unity Landing Analysis (90% COMPLETE)
**Strategic Value**: Validate real vs. assumed component requirements to prevent over-engineering
**Hypothesis Test**: Testing whether 14 real components vs 30 specifications is accurate scope
**Evidence Goal**: Clear component validation and use case mapping for stakeholder review
**Strategic Connection**: Essential for informed scope decisions and MVP definition

### Story Progress
- **Completion**: 90% 
- **Tasks Complete**: 2 of 3 (Analysis complete, Initiation fix complete; Testing pending)
- **Key Insights**: 14 real Unity components identified, strategic validation system needed
- **Next Decision**: Stakeholder scope approval based on Unity analysis

## Task Strategic Context
### Task Purpose: T008: Strategic Initiation Testing (NEXT TASK)
**Strategic Value**: Validate that strategic initiation system solves context recall failures effectively
**Quality Standard**: Perfect session continuity with strategic understanding demonstration
**Evidence Generation**: Proof that strategic validation prevents memorization without comprehension
**Decision Support**: Confirms reliable session management foundation for stakeholder validation process

### Task Progress
- **Status**: READY TO START
- **Next Actions**: 
  1. Test INITIALIZE KNOW-BASE-MCP SESSION STRATEGIC-VALIDATION-MODE command
  2. Validate strategic understanding at each checkpoint
  3. Confirm perfect session continuity and git state accuracy
- **Success Criteria**: Seamless session initiation with demonstrated strategic comprehension
- **Completion Timeline**: Next session for initial testing and validation

## Technical Context (Strategic Framework)
### Technical Approach
**Strategic Rationale**: Modular initiation system with validation checkpoints serves strategic continuity goals
**Quality Alignment**: Strategic validation ensures 8+/10 understanding quality, not just information loading
**Decision Architecture**: Reliable session management enables effective stakeholder decision processes

### Cannabis Industry Context
**Compliance Alignment**: Strategic validation approach applicable to cannabis compliance validation processes
**Industry Value**: Systematic session management demonstrates reliability for cannabis industry stakeholders
**Specialization**: Strategic approach shows understanding of cannabis industry documentation requirements

## Next Session Strategic Focus
**Primary Objective**: Test strategic initiation system effectiveness with full validation protocol
**Strategic Decision**: Determine if strategic validation approach successfully prevents context recall failures
**Evidence Goal**: Demonstrate perfect session continuity with strategic understanding validation
**Success Measure**: Seamless session handoff with strategic comprehension, ready for stakeholder scope validation
