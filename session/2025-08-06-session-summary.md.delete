# Session Summary - August 06, 2025

**Session Date**: August 06, 2025  
**Session Focus**: Repository Separation Planning + Registry System Enhancement  
**Duration**: Full strategic session  
**Phase**: File Organization & PM System Validation  

## ðŸŽ¯ SESSION ACCOMPLISHMENTS

### **Strategic Clarifications Made**
- **Components Understanding**: Components are process testing tools to validate end-to-end workflow, NOT scope selection decisions
- **Repository Architecture**: Planned three-system separation to prevent PM/project file confusion
- **Product-Specific Design**: Each know-base-mcp instance customized for specific company/product (cannabis/jmp/)
- **Demo/Production Separation**: jmp-content designed for standalone demonstration + easy production integration

### **Major Work Completed**
- âœ… **Repository Separation Plan**: Created P001 with comprehensive three-system architecture
- âœ… **Registry System Enhancement**: Added plans-registry.md and analysis-registry.md with Epicâ†’Storyâ†’Taskâ†’Analysis/Plan relationships
- âœ… **Process Improvements**: Created file-creation-process.md with automatic registry updates and linking requirements
- âœ… **Task Creation**: T009 - File Inventory Review with Enhanced Context ready for next session
- âœ… **Documentation Updates**: Enhanced README.md, STATUS.md, and documentation navigation
- âœ… **Process Templates**: Enhanced --update-docs and --end-session commands with enforcement and validation

### **Files Created/Modified This Session**
- `docs/plans/P001-repository-separation-plan.md` - Three-system architecture plan
- `docs/processes/file-creation-process.md` - Systematic file creation with registry integration  
- `pm/registry/plans-registry.md` - Plans tracking with Epicâ†’Storyâ†’Taskâ†’Analysis/Plan relationships
- `pm/registry/analysis-registry.md` - Analysis tracking with Epicâ†’Storyâ†’Taskâ†’Analysis/Plan relationships
- `pm/tasks/T009-file-inventory-review/task.md` - High-priority file review task
- `docs/README.md` - Documentation navigation and organization
- Enhanced `COMMANDS.md` with improved --update-docs and --end-session processes
- Updated `README.md`, `STATUS.md`, and PM tracking files

### **Strategic Decisions Made**
- **Repository Separation**: Three-system architecture (know-docs PM, know-base-mcp cannabis generator, jmp-content runtime output)
- **Decision Management**: Store decisions in task artifacts rather than separate registry system (archived standalone decision files)
- **File Creation Process**: Automatic registry updates and linking for all new project files
- **PM System Evolution**: Enhanced registry system preparing for extraction to reusable know-docs repository

## ðŸ”„ GIT COMMIT TRACKING

### **Git Commands for Human Execution**
```bash
cd /Users/jon/git/know-base-mcp
git add .
git commit -m "COMPLETE Repository Separation Planning + Registry System Enhancement

REPOSITORY SEPARATION ARCHITECTURE:
- Created P001: Repository Separation Plan defining three-system architecture
- know-docs: Reusable PM system (replaces existing know-docs repository)
- know-base-mcp: Cannabis guide generator for JMP with product-specific customization (cannabis/jmp/)
- jmp-content: Runtime output with demo/production separation for standalone demo + easy integration

PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS:
- Created file-creation-process.md with automatic registry updates and linking requirements
- Added plans-registry.md and analysis-registry.md with Epicâ†’Storyâ†’Taskâ†’Analysis/Plan relationships  
- Enhanced --update-docs command with registry validation and compliance checking
- Enhanced --end-session command with mandatory output format and step enforcement

STRATEGIC CLARIFICATIONS:
- Components are process testing tools to validate end-to-end workflow, not scope selection decisions
- Product-specific architecture: each know-base-mcp customized for specific company/product needs
- jmp-content designed for demo/production separation with framework-agnostic integration
- Repository separation after file review + design completion for clean migration

Epic: E001: Project Management System (95% complete)
Story: S001: Create PM Capabilities (95% complete)  
Task: T009: File Inventory Review with Enhanced Context (CREATED - Ready for execution)

NEXT SESSION: T009 execution with separation-aware file review"
git push origin main
git status
```

### **Expected Git State After Commit**
- **Working Directory**: Clean (no uncommitted changes)
- **Branch**: main, up to date with origin
- **Repository State**: Repository separation planned with enhanced registry system

### **Commit Impact**
- **Strategic Foundation**: Three-system architecture addresses organizational confusion
- **Enhanced PM System**: Registry tracking with Epicâ†’Storyâ†’Taskâ†’Analysis/Plan relationships
- **Process Improvements**: Systematic file creation with automatic registry updates
- **Next Session Preparation**: T009 ready for execution with comprehensive context

## ðŸŽ¯ NEXT SESSION PREPARATION

### **Primary Objective**
Execute T009 - File Inventory Review with Enhanced Context using separation-aware annotations for clean repository migration planning

### **Key Context for Next Session**
- **Repository separation plan** approved and documented
- **Enhanced file creation process** with automatic registry updates
- **Components as process testing tools** understanding established
- **Three-system architecture** prevents PM/project file confusion

### **Success Criteria for Next Session**
- Enhanced file inventory with separation-aware annotations
- Clear categorization for clean repository migration (PM vs. cannabis vs. runtime)
- Usage decisions for all existing files (use, validate, archive)
- Gap identification for complete process testing workflow support

### **Strategic Initiation Command**
```
