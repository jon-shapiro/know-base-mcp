git commit -m "COMPREHENSIVE Registry Validation + Gap Analysis + Process Failure Correction

REGISTRY VALIDATION COMPLETE:
- Updated use-case-registry.md with 21 total use cases (was 12) - found 9 additional in know-docs scenarios
- Corrected epic-registry.md progress to 90% (not 95%) with accurate use case mappings for UC-16 through UC-21
- Fixed task-registry.md with T010 COMPLETE status and proper 5-task count in S001
- Updated plans-registry.md with P008 COMPLETE including comprehensive gap analysis
- Enhanced story-registry.md to reflect corrected 80% progress and 5 tasks
- Updated active-work.md with gap analysis, process failure documentation, and corrected priorities

PROCESS FAILURE CORRECTION:
- T010 created retroactively to fix P008 orphaning (document created without task)
- T011 created for systematic process failure prevention and registry audit
- Enhanced --update-docs command with registry validation requirements
- File creation process strengthened with automatic registry update requirements

COMPREHENSIVE GAP ANALYSIS:
- Additional Use Cases: UC-16 through UC-21 found in know-docs JMP scenarios (9 use cases)
- Document Consolidation: 30 hours work identified for overlap resolution before requirements phase
- Component Specifications: 13 of 16 missing specifications documented
- Quality Standards: Complete 8+/10 framework creation required
- MCP Architecture: Server specifications and integration design requirements identified

REGISTRY CROSS-VALIDATION:
- All Epic→Story→Task→Plan relationships validated and accurate
- All referenced files exist in file system
- All use case assignments updated across E002-E004 epics
- Process failure prevention measures implemented
- Complete backlog documentation with registry links

Epic: E001: Project Management System (90% complete - Registry validation + gap analysis complete)
Story: S001: Create PM Capabilities (80% complete - 5 tasks, T010 complete, T009/T011 high priority)
Task: T009: File Inventory Review + T011: Process Failure Correction (HIGH PRIORITY for next session)

NEXT SESSION: Execute T009 file inventory review + T011 process audit with validated registry foundation"

git push origin main
git status
```

## Git State Validation
After executing commands, git status should show:
- **Working directory**: Clean (no uncommitted changes)
- **Branch status**: Up to date with origin/main  
- **Repository state**: Registry validation complete with comprehensive gap analysis

**If git state doesn't match expected**: Report discrepancy immediately for investigation
