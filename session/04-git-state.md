git commit -m "SESSION 20: Strategic Sustainability Analysis + System Crisis Identification

CRITICAL SYSTEM SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS:
- Identified context overload threat: system failure within 20-30 sessions
- Corrected T009 status: NOT_STARTED (was incorrectly marked complete)  
- Completed registry audit via T011: process integrity restored
- Created system sustainability framework: Epic 19 + 5 critical decisions
- Documented hidden failure modes: context corruption, registry drift, state corruption

STRATEGIC ANALYSIS COMPLETE:
- session-20-analysis-complete.md: Complete analysis summary
- stakeholder-decisions-required.md: 5 critical YES/NO decisions
- Session handoff documents updated with sustainability crisis context
- Registry loading strategy designed for context scaling prevention

86 FEATURE ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK:
- Identified ~30-40% features need archiving (duplicates, over-engineered)
- Feature grooming plan created for cleaner backlog
- Registry loading strategy prevents context overload
- Project inception process designed for repository migration

SYSTEM SUSTAINABILITY FRAMEWORK:
- Epic 19 specification: 7 features for system scaling
- Registry loading strategy: smart context by project phase  
- Feature grooming approach: archive problematic features
- Project inception process: know-pm to dedicated repo workflow
- Context scaling solution: prevent context death spiral

Epic: E001 Project Management System - 80% complete (foundation solid, sustainability threats identified)
Story: S001 Create PM Capabilities - 80% complete (T009 corrected to NOT_STARTED)
Next Priority: System sustainability framework implementation (Epic 19 + T009)

READY FOR SESSION 21: System sustainability crisis documented, execution plan ready"
