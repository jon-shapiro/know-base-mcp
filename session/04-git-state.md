git commit -m "COMPLETE Repository Separation Planning + Registry System Enhancement

REPOSITORY SEPARATION ARCHITECTURE:
- Created P001: Repository Separation Plan defining three-system architecture
- know-docs: Reusable PM system (replaces existing know-docs repository)
- know-base-mcp: Cannabis guide generator for JMP with product-specific customization (cannabis/jmp/)
- jmp-content: Runtime output with demo/production separation for standalone demo + easy integration

PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS:
- Created file-creation-process.md with automatic registry updates and linking requirements
- Added plans-registry.md and analysis-registry.md with Epic→Story→Task→Analysis/Plan relationships  
- Enhanced --update-docs command with registry validation and compliance checking
- Integrated decision management into task artifacts (archived standalone decision files)

STRATEGIC CLARIFICATIONS:
- Components are process testing tools to validate end-to-end workflow, not scope selection decisions
- Product-specific architecture: each know-base-mcp customized for specific company/product needs
- jmp-content designed for demo/production separation with framework-agnostic integration
- Repository separation after file review + design completion for clean migration

REGISTRY SYSTEM ENHANCEMENTS:
- All plans and analysis now tracked in registries with proper Epic→Story→Task→Analysis/Plan linking
- T009: File Inventory Review with Enhanced Context created as high-priority task
- File creation process ensures automatic registry updates and relationship establishment
- Cross-references maintained bidirectionally for complete project tracking

ORGANIZATIONAL FOUNDATION:
- Clear separation plan prevents confusion between PM system and project files
- Reusable PM system enables future software project management capabilities
- Product-specific cannabis generator focused on JMP company customization
- Demo/production separation enables standalone demonstration + easy production integration

Epic: E001: Project Management System (95% complete - Repository separation planned)
Story: S001: Create PM Capabilities (95% complete - Registry system enhanced with separation planning)  
Task: T009: File Inventory Review with Enhanced Context (CREATED - Ready for next session execution)

NEXT SESSION: T009 execution with separation-aware file review and enhanced context annotations"
