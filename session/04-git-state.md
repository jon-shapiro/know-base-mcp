git commit -m "COMPLETE File Organization System + PM System Validation

FILE ORGANIZATION SYSTEM IMPLEMENTED:
- Created FILE-INDEX.md - Master file index referencing detailed category indexes
- Created session/SESSION-FILE-INDEX.md - Detailed session management file organization  
- Created SYSTEM-OPERATIONS-INDEX.md - Detailed system operations file organization
- Updated STRATEGIC-INITIATION-SYSTEM.md - Uses existing PM registry instead of duplicate system
- Updated README.md - Current organized system status ready for user guide development

PM SYSTEM VALIDATION COMPLETE:
- Validated existing Epic→Story→Task→Analysis/Plan linking system working correctly
- Preserved pm/registry/ system with epic-registry.md, story-registry.md, task-registry.md, active-work.md
- Removed duplicate WORK-ITEM-REGISTRY.md that was redundant with existing registry system
- Confirmed T001→S001→E001 hierarchy with T001-analysis.md and T001-plan.md linking intact

CLEANUP COMPLETED:
- Removed 5 junk files from failed Phase 0 work (enhanced-end-session, operational-rules, etc.)
- Integrated --cleanup-junk command into COMMANDS.md for ongoing repository hygiene
- File organization system prevents future clutter accumulation

STRATEGIC ACHIEVEMENT:
- Clean organized system prevents project-killing clutter while maintaining PM capabilities
- Epic/Story/Task/Analysis/Plan linking system preserved and validated as working
- File indexes provide clear organization without duplicate tracking systems
- Repository ready for productive user guide development work

SYSTEM ORGANIZATION BENEFITS:
- Master file index + category indexes prevent file accumulation
- Clear purpose and location mapping for all files
- Cleanup processes integrated to maintain organization
- PM system integrity preserved with proper Epic→Story→Task→Analysis/Plan linking

FILE ORGANIZATION STRUCTURE:
- Master index references detailed category indexes (no duplication)
- Session management files organized with relationships documented
- System operations files indexed with dependencies tracked
- PM registry system preserved as working Epic/Story/Task linking system

Epic: E001: Project Management System (95% complete - System validated and organized)
Story: S001: Create PM Capabilities (95% complete - PM system working with file organization)
Task: T001: PM Requirements Analysis (COMPLETE - System validation and organization complete)
