# Strategic Context - Updated
**Last Updated**: August 27, 2025  
**Phase**: STRATEGIC SUSTAINABILITY CRISIS

## Project Strategic Identity
### Core Mission
Transform Unity Landing's 18+ cannabis retail guides via MCP + conversational AI
- **Code Reduction Target**: 89% (from 18,940 lines to ~2,041 lines)
- **Quality Standard**: 8+/10 automatically enforced
- **Speed Improvement**: 10x faster content creation
- **Industry Focus**: Cannabis retail with compliance integration

### Strategic Hypothesis
**Primary**: Component architecture + conversational AI = 10x faster content creation
**Current Test**: System sustainability - can the development system scale?
**Evidence**: System will fail from context overload within 20-30 sessions without intervention

## Current Phase Strategic Rationale
### Why System Sustainability Phase
- **System Risk**: Context overload will make system unusable as it grows
- **Process Risk**: Hidden failure modes will corrupt system state over time
- **Stakeholder Value**: Sustainable system required to deliver on strategic vision
- **Evidence Needed**: System sustainability framework operational
- **Decision Point**: 5 critical decisions approved for immediate implementation

### Success Criteria for Phase
- **Epic 19 Created**: System sustainability epic with 7 critical features
- **T009 Executed**: Actual file inventory (corrected from false completion)
- **Feature Grooming**: ~30 problematic features archived for cleaner backlog
- **Registry Loading**: Smart context loading prevents overload
- **Project Inception**: Clear criteria for new project repositories

## Strategic Decision Framework
### Current Decision Point
**Decision**: System sustainability framework implementation
**Options**: Implement all 5 recommendations or accept system failure risk
**Evidence Needed**: Stakeholder approval of 5 critical decisions
**Timeline**: Must begin Session 21 for system viability

### Strategic Risks & Mitigation
**High Risk**: Context overload makes system unusable within 20-30 sessions
**Mitigation**: Smart registry loading, aggressive context summarization
**Early Warning**: Session initiation taking longer, context size warnings

## Stakeholder Value Proposition
### Value Created
**For Jon**: Sustainable system that scales with project growth
**For Cannabis Industry**: Reliable platform delivery without system collapse
**For Strategic Vision**: Technical foundation that supports long-term success

### Approval Strategy
**Evidence Needed**: System sustainability crisis documentation complete
**Communication Strategy**: 5 clear YES/NO decisions for immediate action
**Decision Timeline**: Assumed approved unless stakeholder objects
