## 🎯 CONTEXT MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES

### **Primary Goals**
1. **Eliminate context loss** between sessions
2. **Preserve decision rationale** and alternatives considered
3. **Track evolving requirements** and assumption validation
4. **Enable quick context restoration** for new sessions
5. **Build searchable knowledge base** for project information

### **Success Criteria**
- **< 5 minutes** to restore full context at session start
- **Zero repeated work** due to context loss
- **100% decision traceability** with rationale and alternatives
- **Searchable project knowledge** for quick information retrieval

## 🏗️ CONTEXT MANAGEMENT ARCHITECTURE

### **Three-Layer Context System**

#### Layer 1: Session Context (Tactical)
**Purpose**: Immediate session state and next actions
**Storage**: Session-specific markdown files
**Retention**: Full session history for project duration

#### Layer 2: Project Context (Strategic)  
**Purpose**: Overall project state, decisions, and knowledge
**Storage**: Structured documentation with cross-references
**Retention**: Permanent project knowledge base

#### Layer 3: Meta-Context (Process)
**Purpose**: How we work, lessons learned, process improvements
**Storage**: Template-driven process documentation
**Retention**: Reusable for future projects

## 🔄 CONTEXT MANAGEMENT PROTOCOLS

### **Session Start Protocol**
**Standard Operating Procedure for Beginning Each Session**

#### Step 1: Context Loading (5 minutes)
```markdown
Context Loading Checklist:
- [ ] Read previous session summary
- [ ] Review current project status
- [ ] Check decision log for recent decisions
- [ ] Scan task registry for active items
- [ ] Identify any blockers or dependencies
- [ ] Load relevant working documents
```

#### Step 2: Objective Setting (2 minutes)
```markdown
Session Planning:
- [ ] Define primary session objectives (1-3 items)
- [ ] Identify success criteria for session
- [ ] Note any time constraints or limitations
- [ ] Flag potential blockers or decisions needed
```

#### Step 3: Context Validation (1 minute)
```markdown
Validation Questions:
- Is the project status accurate?
- Are there any missing context pieces?
- Do objectives align with overall project goals?
- Are all necessary resources available?
```

### **During-Session Protocol**
**Continuous Context Capture During Work**

#### Decision Tracking
```markdown
Real-time Decision Capture:
- Record decision trigger (what prompted decision)
- List options considered (with pros/cons)
- Document final decision and rationale
- Note implementation implications
- Assign follow-up actions if needed
```

#### Task Creation
```markdown
New Task Protocol:
- Assign unique task ID
- Define clear acceptance criteria
- Estimate effort/complexity
- Assign owner and due date
- Link to related decisions or requirements
```

### **Session End Protocol**

- [ ] List new tasks created
- [ ] Note any discoveries or insights
- [ ] Identify next session priorities
```

## 🚨 RISK MITIGATION

### **Context Management Risks**
1. **Process overhead**: Too much documentation slows work
2. **Information overload**: Too much context to process effectively
3. **Template rigidity**: Process doesn't adapt to actual needs
4. **Tool dependency**: System breaks if files are lost or corrupted

### **Mitigation Strategies**
1. **Streamlined templates**: Focus on essential information only
2. **Progressive disclosure**: Start with summaries, drill down as needed
