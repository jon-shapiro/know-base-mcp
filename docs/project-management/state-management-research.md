# State Management Research & Implementation
## What Actually Works: Evidence-Based Memory System

**Research Date**: August 04, 2025
**Implementation**: SIMPLE FILE-BASED SYSTEM (Proven Effective)

---

## 📊 RESEARCH EVIDENCE

### **What Worked in Previous Projects**

#### 1. Know-Docs Template System ✅
**Evidence**: Simple markdown templates with clear structure
- **Directory-based organization** with README navigation
- **Template-driven content** with consistent formatting
- **Version history tracking** in markdown headers
- **Cross-reference linking** between related documents

#### 2. Know-Proj Simple Tracking ✅ 
**Evidence**: System diagnosis succeeded with simple tracking
- **Status-based progress** (COMPLETE, IN PROGRESS, BLOCKED)
- **Session-based file creation** with clear naming
- **Evidence-based recommendations** with next steps
- **Simple file organization** with clear purposes

#### 3. Claude Code Memory Management ✅
**Evidence**: Claude Code uses cascaded memory files for session continuity
- **CLAUDE.md project memory** file for persistent context
- **Lean memory files** to preserve context window space
- **Specific, project-unique instructions** rather than generic guidance
- **Docs folder for reference** materials loaded on-demand

### **What Failed in Previous Projects**

#### 1. Over-Complex Systems ❌
- **Complex tracking systems** led to abandonment
- **Too many files** caused navigation overhead
- **Abstract architectures** without immediate value

#### 2. Generic Documentation ❌
- **Generic instructions** like "follow best practices" are ineffective
- **Overwhelming detail** wastes context tokens
- **Process-heavy approaches** slow down actual work

## 🎯 IMPLEMENTED SOLUTION: SIMPLE STATE SYSTEM

### **Architecture: Proven File-Based Approach**

Based on research findings, implementing the SIMPLEST system that works:

#### **Core Memory Structure**
```
know-base-mcp/
├── CLAUDE.md                    # Project memory (Claude Code pattern)
├── STATUS.md                    # Current state (Know-Proj pattern)
├── docs/
│   ├── decisions/               # Decision log (event sourcing)
│   ├── sessions/                # Session summaries (what worked)
│   └── files/                   # File inventory (SSOT tracking)
├── templates/                   # Reusable templates (Know-Docs pattern)
└── working/                     # Active work files
```

#### **Memory Management Pattern**
**Source**: Claude Code cascaded memory system

1. **CLAUDE.md**: Project-specific context loaded every session
2. **STATUS.md**: Current state and immediate next actions  
3. **Session files**: Historical context with decisions and rationale
4. **File inventory**: Track all files with purpose and status

## 📋 IMPLEMENTATION

### **1. Project Memory (CLAUDE.md)**
**Purpose**: Persistent context loaded every Claude session
**Pattern**: Keep lean, project-specific, actionable

### **2. Current Status (STATUS.md)** 
**Purpose**: Quick session startup context
**Pattern**: Simple status tracking that actually worked

### **3. Decision Log (docs/decisions/)**
**Purpose**: Decision rationale and alternatives
**Pattern**: Lightweight event sourcing for decision traceability

### **4. File Inventory (docs/files/)**
**Purpose**: Track all key files with purpose and links
**Pattern**: SSOT for file understanding and validation
