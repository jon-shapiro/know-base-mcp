# Project Management Framework

**Purpose**: Systematic approach to project execution with context preservation and quality gates
**Status**: Framework designed and ready for implementation
**Approach**: Evidence-based, lightweight, and proven effective

## üìã PROJECT MANAGEMENT DOCUMENTS

### 1. [PM Strategy Research](pm-strategy-research.md) üìö FOUNDATION
**Purpose**: Best practices research for AI-assisted development projects  
**Key Findings**: Simple file-based systems outperform complex ones for context preservation  
**Recommendation**: Lightweight, systematic approach with proven patterns

### 2. [Context Management Design](context-management-design.md) üß† CORE SYSTEM
**Purpose**: Session continuity and knowledge preservation across AI interactions  
**Key Innovation**: File-based memory system (CLAUDE.md + STATUS.md + session files)  
**Success Factor**: Prevents context loss that caused previous project failures

### 3. [Task Tracking Framework](task-tracking-design.md) üìä WORK MANAGEMENT
**Purpose**: Systematic work progress tracking with quality gates  
**Key Features**: Priority-based task management with clear completion criteria  
**Integration**: Seamless connection with context management system

## üéØ PROJECT MANAGEMENT PHILOSOPHY

### EVIDENCE-BASED APPROACH
- **Validation before development** - No building on unvalidated assumptions
- **User research required** - All interface decisions based on user feedback
- **Technical audit mandatory** - Architecture decisions based on actual codebase analysis
- **Scope control** - MVP boundaries with explicit feature exclusions

### CONTEXT PRESERVATION PRIORITY
- **Session continuity** - Every session builds on previous work systematically
- **Decision tracking** - All decisions logged with rationale and alternatives
- **Knowledge retention** - Project memory maintained across AI interactions
- **Progress visibility** - Real-time status tracking with clear blockers

### QUALITY GATES & RISK MITIGATION
- **Validation phase gates** - No development without stakeholder approval
- **User research gates** - No interface work without user validation
- **Technical audit gates** - No architecture decisions without codebase analysis
- **Scope validation gates** - No feature development without evidence of need

```

### PHASE GATES & CRITERIA
1. **Validation Gate**: All assumptions validated or simplified
2. **Research Gate**: User feedback collected and analyzed  
3. **Technical Gate**: Architecture verified with actual codebase
4. **Scope Gate**: MVP boundaries clearly defined and approved
5. **Development Gate**: Begin building with validated requirements

## üìä CONTEXT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

### FILE-BASED MEMORY ARCHITECTURE
- **[CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md)** - Project memory and key information
- **[STATUS.md](../../STATUS.md)** - Real-time project state and blockers
- **[Session Files](../context/sessions/)** - Work completed each session
- **[Decision Log](../decisions/decision-log.md)** - All decisions with rationale

### PROVEN EFFECTIVE PATTERNS
Based on successful projects:
- **Know-docs template system** - Simple file organization worked well
- **Claude Code memory pattern** - CLAUDE.md approach proven effective
- **Know-proj diagnosis success** - Simple tracking enabled problem resolution

### CONTEXT RETENTION TESTING
- **30-question diagnostic** - Validates AI memory retention between sessions
- **State verification** - Confirms project context preservation
- **Progress continuity** - Ensures seamless work resumption

## üéØ TASK TRACKING APPROACH

### PRIORITY-BASED ORGANIZATION
- **üî¥ CRITICAL** - Blocks all progress, immediate attention required
- **üü° HIGH** - Important for timeline, address within 1-2 days
- **üü¢ MEDIUM** - Standard priority, complete within week
- **‚ö™ LOW** - Nice to have, address when time permits

### STATUS TRACKING SYSTEM
- **‚úÖ COMPLETE** - Work finished and validated
- **üîÑ IN PROGRESS** - Currently being worked on
- **‚è∏Ô∏è BLOCKED** - Waiting for external dependency
- **üìã PENDING** - Queued for future work

### QUALITY CRITERIA
Every task includes:
- **Clear completion criteria** - Objective success metrics
- **Validation requirements** - How success will be measured
- **Dependency tracking** - What must complete first
- **Risk mitigation** - Fallback plans for common issues

## üö® RISK MANAGEMENT

### IDENTIFIED RISKS & MITIGATION
1. **Context Loss Risk** ‚Üí File-based memory system
2. **Scope Creep Risk** ‚Üí Validation gates and MVP boundaries  
3. **Assumption Risk** ‚Üí User research and technical audit requirements
4. **Over-Engineering Risk** ‚Üí Evidence-based feature justification

### SUCCESS PATTERNS APPLIED
- **Simple beats complex** - Lightweight systems get adopted and maintained
- **Documentation enables success** - Clear tracking prevents confusion
- **Validation prevents rework** - Upfront validation saves development time
- **Context preservation critical** - Memory systems enable project continuity
