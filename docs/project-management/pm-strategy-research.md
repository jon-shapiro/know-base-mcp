## 🔍 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY

### **Problem Analysis**
**Previous Project Failures**:
- **Context loss** across sessions despite documentation
- **Scope creep** from simple ideas to complex systems
- **Assumption accumulation** without validation
- **Poor task tracking** leading to repeated work

**Root Causes Identified**:
1. **Insufficient upfront validation** of requirements
2. **Lack of systematic task breakdown** and progress tracking
3. **Poor context preservation** between sessions
4. **No clear decision-making framework** for scope management

## 📚 BEST PRACTICES RESEARCH

### **Agile/Lean Principles for AI Projects**

#### 1. Validation-First Development
**Source**: Lean Startup methodology adapted for AI projects
**Principle**: "Build-Measure-Learn" cycle with emphasis on early validation

**Application to Know-Base-MCP**:
- **Validate user needs** before building features
- **Test assumptions** with minimal viable implementations
- **Measure actual usage** vs. theoretical requirements
- **Learn and pivot** based on real feedback

#### 2. Risk-Driven Development
**Source**: Software risk management best practices
**Principle**: Address highest-risk assumptions first

**Application to Know-Base-MCP**:
- **Technical risks**: Unity Landing integration complexity
- **User adoption risks**: Conversational interface acceptance
- **Scope risks**: Cannabis compliance necessity
- **Business risks**: ROI and maintenance burden

#### 3. Incremental Value Delivery
**Source**: Agile software development principles
**Principle**: Deliver working software frequently

**Application to Know-Base-MCP**:
- **Week 1**: Simple component extraction from existing guides
- **Week 2**: Basic template system for new content
- **Week 3**: Single MCP tool for content creation
- **Week 4**: Quality validation and improvement

### **AI-Specific Project Management**

#### 1. Assumption Tracking
**Source**: Machine learning project management research
**Principle**: Explicitly track and validate all assumptions

**Implementation Framework**:
```
Assumption Registry:
- ID: A001
- Description: "Users prefer conversational interface"
- Risk Level: High
- Validation Method: User interviews
- Status: Unvalidated
- Impact if Wrong: Major rework of interface
```

#### 2. Context Preservation Systems
**Source**: Knowledge management and documentation practices
**Principle**: Systematic capture and retrieval of project context

**Implementation Framework**:
- **Session summaries** with decisions and next steps
- **Decision logs** with rationale and alternatives considered
- **Work product registry** with current status and dependencies
- **Knowledge base** with searchable project information

#### 3. Scope Management Framework
**Source**: Project scope management best practices
**Principle**: Clear boundaries with explicit change control

**Implementation Framework**:
- **MVP definition** with clear inclusion/exclusion criteria
- **Feature backlog** with priority ranking and effort estimates
- **Change request process** with impact assessment
- **Scope creep detection** with early warning systems

## 🎯 RECOMMENDED PROJECT MANAGEMENT APPROACH

### **Phase-Gate Methodology**

#### Phase 1: Validation (1-2 weeks)
**Objective**: Validate all assumptions before development
**Gate Criteria**: 
- [ ] User interviews completed (3+ participants)
- [ ] Technical feasibility confirmed
- [ ] Scope clearly defined and approved
- [ ] Success criteria established

**Deliverables**:
- Validated user requirements
- Technical architecture validation
- Approved project scope
- Success metrics definition

#### Phase 2: MVP Development (4-6 weeks)
**Objective**: Build minimal viable product with core features
**Gate Criteria**:
- [ ] Core functionality working
- [ ] User testing completed
- [ ] Quality standards met
- [ ] Deployment ready

**Deliverables**:
- Working MVP with validated features
- User feedback and acceptance
- Deployment documentation
- Maintenance procedures

#### Phase 3: Enhancement (Ongoing)
**Objective**: Iterate based on real usage and feedback
**Gate Criteria**:
- [ ] Usage metrics collected
- [ ] User satisfaction measured
- [ ] Enhancement priorities validated
- [ ] Resource allocation approved

#### 2. Task Tracking System
**Format**: Hierarchical task breakdown with dependencies
**Status Tracking**: Not Started / In Progress / Blocked / Complete
**Effort Estimation**: Story points or time-based estimates
**Assignment**: Clear ownership and accountability

#### 3. Progress Monitoring
**Daily**: Task status updates and blocker identification
**Weekly**: Progress review and priority adjustment
**Bi-weekly**: Stakeholder review and scope validation

## 📊 CONTEXT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM DESIGN

### **Session Continuity Framework**

#### 1. Session Templates
**Pre-Session**: 
- [ ] Review previous session summary
- [ ] Load current task context
- [ ] Identify session objectives
- [ ] Prepare necessary files/documents

**During Session**:
- [ ] Document decisions made
- [ ] Track new tasks created
- [ ] Note assumptions or risks identified
- [ ] Capture action items

**Post-Session**:
- [ ] Create session summary
- [ ] Update project status
- [ ] Plan next session objectives
- [ ] Update knowledge base

#### 2. Knowledge Repository Structure

#### 3. Context Loading Protocol
**Standard Operating Procedure**:
1. **Load session summary** from previous session
2. **Review task registry** for current work items
3. **Check decision log** for recent decisions
4. **Scan knowledge base** for relevant information
5. **Update stakeholder** on progress and blockers
