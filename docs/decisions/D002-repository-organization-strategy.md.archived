# Decision: Repository Organization Strategy

**Decision ID**: D002  
**Date**: August 06, 2025  
**Type**: Architecture Decision  
**Impact**: High - Defines project structure  
**Status**: Approved  

## Decision Summary
Implement structured separation (Option C) with three distinct systems organized into separate repositories with planned migration timeline.

## Repository Structure Decision

### **System 1: know-docs** (Replaces existing know-docs repo)
- **Purpose**: Reusable project management system for any software project
- **Content**: Epic/Story/Task templates, registries, processes, PM workflows
- **Migration**: Extract from know-base-mcp, replace existing know-docs repository
- **Reuse Value**: Generic PM system for future software projects

### **System 2: know-base-mcp** (Current repo, cleaned)
- **Purpose**: Cannabis user guide generator with multi-industry capability
- **Content**: Component specs, conversion tools, MCP server, industry patterns
- **Evolution**: Remove PM files after extraction, focus on guide generation
- **Multi-Industry**: Support cannabis → stereo → other industry knowledge bases

### **System 3: jmp-content** (New deployment repo)
- **Purpose**: Runtime content output for consuming websites
- **Content**: Generated liquid templates, compiled assets, deployment files
- **Integration**: Output from know-base-mcp for website deployment
- **Scalability**: Support multiple industry content outputs

## Decisions File Management Decision

### **Integration with File Cleanup Process**
- **Approach**: Add decisions review to existing file cleanup process
- **Lifecycle**: Active, Superseded, Archived status tracking
- **Cleanup**: Periodic review during regular file cleanup cycles
- **No Separate Process**: Leverage existing cleanup workflow

### **Strategic Initiation Integration**
- **Add Decisions Review**: Include active decisions review in strategic initiation
- **Current Decisions**: Load active decisions affecting current work
- **Decision Context**: Understand strategic decisions shaping current session
- **Archive Awareness**: Know when decisions have been superseded

## Implementation Approach: Plan C (Structured Separation)

### **Phase 1: Immediate Planning** ✅ IN PROGRESS
- Document separation plan with clear boundaries
- Create migration strategy for each system
- Establish file organization enabling clean separation
- Continue current work with separation-aware organization

### **Phase 2: PM System Extraction** (After T001/T009 complete)
- Extract PM system to new know-docs repository
- Replace existing know-docs with reusable PM system
- Update know-base-mcp to reference external PM system
- Test PM system independence and reusability

### **Phase 3: Cannabis Project Focus** (After PM extraction)
- Clean know-base-mcp of PM files (keeping reference links)
- Focus on cannabis guide generator with multi-industry capability
- Design jmp-content output strategy
- Plan industry knowledge base architecture

## Strategic Benefits
- **Clean Separation**: Each system has clear purpose and boundaries
- **Reusability**: PM system can be used for any future software project
- **Scalability**: Guide generator supports multiple industries (cannabis → stereo → others)
- **Deployment**: Clean runtime output separated from development tools
- **Industry Knowledge**: Architecture supports company/industry specific knowledge bases

## Next Actions
1. Create detailed Repository Separation Plan
2. Update file cleanup process to include decisions lifecycle
3. Add decisions review to strategic initiation system
4. Continue T009 with separation-aware file organization

---

**Strategic Value**: Clear separation enables reusable PM system while focusing cannabis project and supporting multi-industry expansion
**Implementation**: Structured approach maintains momentum while planning clean separation
**Multi-Industry Vision**: Architecture supports cannabis → stereo → other industry knowledge base development
