## ðŸ“‹ DECISION ENTRIES

### **DEC-001: Validation-First Approach** 
**Date**: August 04, 2025  
**Status**: APPROVED  
**Type**: Process Decision

**Context**: Previous projects failed due to building on unvalidated assumptions

**Options Considered**:
1. **Start development immediately** - Faster to market but high rework risk
2. **Partial validation while building** - Parallel work but context switching overhead  
3. **Complete validation first** - Slower start but prevents major rework

**Decision**: Complete validation first before any development

**Rationale**: 
- Cannabis compliance assumptions could save 9-13 weeks if invalidated
- User research findings could change entire interface approach
- Technical architecture assumptions need verification before building
- Previous context loss issues require systematic approach

**Impact**: 1-2 week delay but prevents potential months of rework

**Implementation**: All development blocked until validation phase complete

### **DEC-002: Cannabis Compliance Scope Reduction**
**Date**: August 04, 2025  
**Status**: FLAGGED FOR VALIDATION  
**Type**: Scope Decision

**Context**: Detailed multi-state regulatory framework documented without source validation

**Options Considered**:
1. **Full automated compliance** - Complex multi-state system (9-13 weeks)
2. **Basic compliance features** - Simple disclaimers and warnings (1-2 weeks)
3. **No compliance automation** - Manual compliance management (0 weeks)

**Decision**: Flag for stakeholder validation - likely over-engineered

**Rationale**:
- No source validation for complex regulatory requirements
- Multi-state automation assumes nationwide operation
- Documentation platforms may not need compliance automation
- Legal expert validation required

**Impact**: Potential 9-13 weeks development time savings

**Next Action**: Stakeholder validation of actual compliance needs

### **DEC-003: Context Management System Implementation**
**Date**: August 04, 2025  
**Status**: APPROVED  
**Type**: Process Decision

**Context**: Previous projects suffered from context loss between sessions

**Options Considered**:
1. **Continue ad-hoc approach** - No overhead but same failure risk
2. **Complex tracking system** - Comprehensive but high overhead
3. **Simple file-based system** - Proven effective in previous success

**Decision**: Implement simple file-based context management

**Rationale**:
- Know-proj system diagnosis succeeded with simple tracking
- Claude Code uses effective CLAUDE.md pattern  
- Know-docs template system worked well
- Simple systems get adopted, complex ones get abandoned

**Impact**: Minimal overhead with systematic context preservation

**Implementation**: CLAUDE.md + STATUS.md + session files + decision log

### **DEC-004: File-Based State Management**
**Date**: August 04, 2025  
**Status**: APPROVED  
**Type**: Technical Decision

**Context**: Need systematic state management without over-engineering

**Options Considered**:
1. **Database-driven system** - Powerful but complex setup
2. **Git-based tracking** - Version control but poor searchability
3. **Simple file system** - Easy to implement and maintain

**Decision**: Simple file-based state management with proven patterns

**Rationale**:
- Research shows Claude Code's file-based memory works well
- Know-docs template system was effective
- Immediate implementation possible without tool dependencies
- Easy to migrate to more complex system later if needed

**Impact**: Working state management system in place immediately

**Implementation**: File inventory + decision log + session summaries

### **DEC-005: Minimal Viable Scope Focus**  
**Date**: August 04, 2025  
**Status**: APPROVED PENDING VALIDATION  
**Type**: Scope Decision

**Context**: Project scope inflation from simple docs to enterprise platform

**Options Considered**:
1. **Full enterprise platform** - Advanced features but 6-12 month timeline
2. **MVP approach** - Core features only, expand based on validation
3. **Proof of concept** - Minimal viable demo

**Decision**: MVP approach with explicit scope boundaries

**Rationale**:
- Enterprise features lack user validation
- 89% code reduction claim needs proof before scaling
- Conversational interface assumption needs validation
- Cannabis specialization may be unnecessary complexity

**Impact**: Focus on core value proposition, expand based on evidence

**Next Action**: Define MVP boundaries after user research
