# Decision: Components as Process Testing Tools

**Decision ID**: D001  
**Date**: August 06, 2025  
**Type**: Strategic Clarification  
**Impact**: High - Changes fundamental project understanding  
**Status**: Documented  

## Decision Context
During strategic initiation, Claude misinterpreted component specifications as scope decisions rather than understanding their role in requirements building and process validation.

## The Clarification
**Previous Understanding**: Components were scope options to choose from (4-30 components)
**Correct Understanding**: Components are part of requirements building process to test end-to-end workflow

### Purpose of Components
- **Requirements building process**: Test whether the end-to-end process works
- **Process validation**: Create and tweak components to prove workflow
- **Conversion testing**: Convert existing liquid to standardized modular component structure
- **ASCII mockup conversion**: Transform mockups to liquid component format

## Process Understanding
1. **Create/tweak components** using specifications
2. **Convert existing liquid** to standardized modular structure  
3. **Convert ASCII mockups** (new/updated guides) to liquid components
4. **Prove out the process** through actual conversion work
5. **Refine requirements** based on process testing results
6. **Design MCP construct** based on validated process

## Project Status Impact
- **Current State**: Have not yet proved out the process
- **Still Need**: Requirements refinement through actual conversion testing
- **Design Phase**: Need MCP construct design based on validated process
- **Approach**: Testing-first rather than scope-selection-first

## Documentation Strategy Decision
**Question**: How to document decisions/clarifications for future context?
**Options**: 
- Session summary only
- Dedicated decisions/clarifications file system
- Hybrid approach

**Recommendation**: Dedicated system because:
- Strategic clarifications too important for session summaries only
- Future sessions need this context to avoid repeated misunderstandings
- Creates pattern for systematic decision documentation
- Enables decision history tracking and reference

## Implementation Impact
- File inventory review with enhanced context annotations needed
- Updated design process required using MCP construct
- Context file extraction and cleanup based on correct understanding
- Requirements refinement through actual process testing

## Next Actions
1. Check for existing file inventory task or create one
2. Review file inventory with annotations for enhanced context
3. Work on updated design based on MCP construct understanding
4. Extract useful context files, create new ones, clean unnecessary ones

**Strategic Value**: Correct understanding enables proper requirements building through process testing rather than premature scope decisions
**Documentation**: Filed under docs/decisions/ for future session reference
**Integration**: Will be referenced in session handoffs and strategic context
