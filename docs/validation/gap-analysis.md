**What We Have**: Cannabis retail focus assumption
**What We Need**:
- [ ] **Alternative solutions evaluation** - existing documentation tools
- [ ] **Build vs. buy analysis** - could existing tools work?
- [ ] **Differentiation strategy** - why build custom vs. adapt existing?
- [ ] **Market validation** - demand for cannabis-specific documentation tools

### **Gap Category 5: OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS** ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM

#### 5.1 Missing Deployment Strategy
**What We Have**: Development plan focused
**What We Need**:

5. How comfortable are you with technical tools?

Interview Method:
- 30-45 minute recorded sessions
- Screen sharing of current workflow
- Task observation (maintenance scenario)
- Follow-up questions based on findings
```

### **Technical Discovery Approach**
```
Discovery Activities:
1. Code audit of Unity Landing repository
2. Content analysis of existing guides
3. Build system documentation review
4. Integration point identification
5. Performance baseline establishment

## üö® RISK MITIGATION

### **High-Risk Gaps**
1. **User Rejection Risk**: Building wrong solution without user validation
2. **Technical Integration Risk**: Assumptions about Unity Landing may be wrong
3. **Scope Creep Risk**: Cannabis compliance complexity may be unnecessary
4. **Adoption Risk**: Conversational interface may not be preferred

### **Mitigation Strategies**
1. **Early User Validation**: Interview users before any development
2. **Technical Spike**: Audit Unity Landing before architecture decisions
3. **MVP Focus**: Start with minimal viable features, expand based on validation
4. **Alternative Planning**: Have backup approaches if assumptions prove wrong
