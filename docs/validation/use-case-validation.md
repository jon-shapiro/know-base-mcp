# Use Case Validation Review
## Identifying Real Needs vs. Generated Assumptions

**Purpose**: Systematic review of all use cases to identify hallucinated vs. real requirements
**Created**: August 04, 2025
**Status**: REQUIRES STAKEHOLDER VALIDATION

---

## üéØ USE CASE ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK

### **Validation Criteria**
- ‚úÖ **REAL**: Based on actual Unity Landing content or documented pain points
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **ASSUMED**: Logical but unvalidated assumptions
- üî¥ **HALLUCINATED**: Generated complexity without validation

---

## üìä CORE USE CASES ANALYSIS

### **Category 1: Content Creation** 

#### UC-1: Conversational Guide Creation
**Stated Need**: "Transform existing docs to component system through natural language"
**Source**: [User Flows Document](https://github.com/jmpinit/know-base/blob/main/docs/user-scenarios/user-flows-consolidated-v5-complete.md)

**Analysis**:
- ‚úÖ **REAL**: Unity Landing has 18+ guides that need maintenance
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **ASSUMED**: Conversational interface is the best solution
- üî¥ **HALLUCINATED**: Complex ASCII mockup ‚Üí HTML conversion workflow

**Questions for Validation**:
1. Is conversational interface actually needed, or would templates work?
2. Are ASCII mockups helpful, or is this unnecessary complexity?
3. What's the actual pain point with current guide maintenance?

#### UC-2: Component Library Development
**Stated Need**: "89% code reduction through reusable components"
**Source**: [PRD Document](https://github.com/jmpinit/know-base/blob/main/PRD-Know-Base.md)

**Analysis**:
- ‚úÖ **REAL**: Repeated content exists across Unity guides
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **ASSUMED**: 89% reduction is achievable and valuable
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **ASSUMED**: 3-tier component architecture is needed

**Questions for Validation**:
1. What specific content is repeated across guides?
2. Is 89% reduction realistic or marketing fluff?
3. Would simple includes/partials solve the problem?

### **Category 2: Cannabis Industry Features**

#### UC-3: Cannabis Compliance Automation
**Stated Need**: "Multi-state regulatory compliance with automated validation"
**Source**: [Cannabis Compliance Document](docs-cannabis-compliance-automation.md)

**Analysis**:
- üî¥ **LIKELY HALLUCINATED**: No source validation for regulatory requirements
- üî¥ **OVER-ENGINEERED**: Complex state-specific rule engines
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **ASSUMED**: Compliance is a major pain point

**Critical Questions**:
1. **Do Unity guides actually need compliance automation?**
2. **What specific cannabis regulations affect documentation?**
3. **Is this solving a real problem or creating complexity?**

#### UC-4: Cannabis Retail Specialization
**Stated Need**: "Built for cannabis retail with industry terminology"
**Source**: [Architecture Document](https://github.com/jmpinit/know-base/blob/main/Architecture-Know-Base.md)

**Analysis**:
- ‚úÖ **REAL**: Unity guides are cannabis-focused
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **ASSUMED**: Heavy specialization is needed vs. generic documentation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **ASSUMED**: Cannabis-specific components are valuable

**Questions for Validation**:
1. What cannabis-specific features are actually needed?
2. Would generic documentation tools work fine?
3. Is industry specialization a differentiator or complexity?

### **Category 3: Technical Architecture**

#### UC-5: MCP Server Integration
**Stated Need**: "Claude Desktop integration with 8 MCP tools"
**Source**: [Initiate Document](initiate.md)

**Analysis**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **ASSUMED**: MCP integration provides value
- üî¥ **OVER-SCOPED**: 8 tools may be excessive for MVP
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **ASSUMED**: Conversational interface is preferred

**Questions for Validation**:
1. What specific MCP tools are actually needed?
2. Would a simple CLI or web interface work better?
3. Is Claude Desktop integration a requirement or nice-to-have?

#### UC-6: Quality Enforcement (8+/10)
**Stated Need**: "Automated quality scoring and enhancement"
**Source**: [Quality Standards](https://github.com/jmpinit/know-base/blob/main/docs/vision/quality-standards.md)

**Analysis**:
- ‚úÖ **REAL**: Quality standards document exists and is validated
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **ASSUMED**: Automated scoring is needed vs. manual review
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **ASSUMED**: 8+/10 is the right threshold

**Questions for Validation**:
1. Is automated quality scoring valuable or over-engineering?
2. What quality issues exist in current guides?
3. Would manual review be sufficient?

## üö® HIGH-RISK ASSUMPTIONS IDENTIFIED

### **Assumption 1: Cannabis Compliance Complexity**
**Risk Level**: üî¥ CRITICAL
**Details**: Extensive multi-state regulatory framework documented without validation
**Impact**: Could drive unnecessary complexity and development time

### **Assumption 2: Conversational Interface Necessity**
**Risk Level**: ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH
**Details**: Complex natural language ‚Üí ASCII ‚Üí HTML workflow
**Impact**: May be solving wrong problem with over-engineered solution

### **Assumption 3: Enterprise-Grade Features**
**Risk Level**: ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH  
**Details**: Advanced monitoring, multi-tenancy, marketplace features
**Impact**: Feature creep beyond actual needs

### **Assumption 4: 89% Code Reduction Target**
**Risk Level**: ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM
**Details**: Specific quantitative target without validation
**Impact**: May drive architecture decisions based on arbitrary metric

- [ ] How many MCP tools are actually useful vs. complex?

#### About User Needs:
- [ ] Who actually maintains Unity Landing guides?
- [ ] What tasks take the most time in current workflow?
- [ ] What quality issues exist in current guides?
- [ ] Is the 8+/10 quality standard realistic and valuable?

#### About Cannabis Specialization:
- [ ] What makes cannabis documentation different from generic docs?

## üéØ RECOMMENDED APPROACH

### **Start With Minimum Viable Scope**
1. **Simple static site generator** with basic templates
2. **Manual quality review** instead of automated scoring
3. **Generic documentation** with cannabis content, not cannabis-specific features
4. **2-3 core MCP tools** instead of 8

### **Validate Before Building**
1. **Interview actual users** of Unity Landing guides
2. **Audit current guides** for real pain points
3. **Test simple solutions** before building complex ones
4. **Validate compliance needs** with legal/regulatory experts

---

**NEXT STEP**: Stakeholder review of all flagged assumptions before any development begins.
