## üìù SESSION END TEMPLATE

```markdown
# Session [NUMBER] Complete - [DATE]

## Work Accomplished
- [MAJOR_ACCOMPLISHMENT_1]
- [MAJOR_ACCOMPLISHMENT_2]
- [MAJOR_ACCOMPLISHMENT_3]

## Files Created/Modified
- [FILE_NAME]: [PURPOSE]
- [FILE_NAME]: [PURPOSE]

## Decisions Made
- [DECISION_SUMMARY] (see DEC-XXX in decision log)

## Next Session Priority
[PRIMARY_FOCUS_FOR_NEXT_SESSION]

## Context Loading Instructions
Next session should read:
1. CLAUDE.md (project memory)
2. STATUS.md (current state)
3. [THIS_SESSION_FILE] (session context)
4. [OTHER_SPECIFIC_FILES] (if needed)

## Session Status: COMPLETE ‚úÖ
```

## üéØ CONTEXT PRESERVATION VERIFICATION

### **Quick Context Check**
Before ending session, verify these are documented:
- [ ] Current project phase and status
- [ ] Recent decisions and rationale  
- [ ] Active blockers and resolution plans
- [ ] Immediate next actions
- [ ] Stakeholder inputs needed

### **Memory System Status**
- [ ] CLAUDE.md updated with current context
- [ ] STATUS.md reflects current state accurately
- [ ] Decision log contains recent decisions
- [ ] File inventory is current
- [ ] Session summary is complete

## üöÄ NEXT SESSION INITIALIZATION

### **Standard Session Start Protocol**
1. **Load Context** (3 minutes):
   - Read CLAUDE.md (project memory)
   - Read STATUS.md (current state)  
   - Read latest session file
   - Scan decision log for recent decisions

2. **Validate Context** (2 minutes):
   - Confirm understanding of current phase
   - Verify active priorities and blockers
   - Check stakeholder actions pending
   - Identify any missing context

3. **Set Session Objectives** (2 minutes):
   - Define primary session goals
   - Identify success criteria
   - Note time constraints or limitations
   - Flag potential decisions needed

### **Context Retention Test**
For next session evaluation, use:
**[Context Retention Diagnostic](context-retention-diagnostic.md)**

## üìä SESSION EFFECTIVENESS METRICS

### **Track These Metrics**
- **Context loading time**: Target < 5 minutes
- **Session startup effectiveness**: Ready to work immediately
- **Context accuracy**: Diagnostic score > 40/50
- **Productivity**: Work begins without context reconstruction

### **Warning Signs**
- Taking >10 minutes to understand current state
- Repeating work from previous sessions
- Missing critical decisions or context
- Unable to continue work seamlessly

---

**IMPLEMENTATION**: Execute this protocol at the end of every session to ensure perfect context preservation.
