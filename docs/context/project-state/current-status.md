# Current Project Status
**Last Updated**: August 04, 2025 - 12:15 PM EST
**Phase**: VALIDATION (Critical Path)
**Overall Progress**: 15% complete (validation framework established)

## Executive Summary
Project has completed comprehensive validation framework design and identified critical scope/assumption issues requiring stakeholder review. All development work is appropriately blocked pending validation of cannabis compliance requirements, user needs, and technical architecture assumptions.

## Active Work Streams
1. **Stakeholder Validation**: BLOCKED - Awaiting review of validation documents
2. **User Research Planning**: READY - Awaiting authorization to begin interviews
3. **Technical Discovery**: READY - Awaiting authorization for Unity Landing audit
4. **Requirements Definition**: BLOCKED - Depends on validation outcomes

## Recent Decisions
- **Aug 04**: Validation-first approach adopted - prevents building on unvalidated assumptions
- **Aug 04**: Cannabis compliance flagged as likely over-engineered - 9-13 weeks potential savings
- **Aug 04**: Context management system designed - prevents previous failure modes
- **Aug 04**: Project management framework established - systematic approach to prevent scope creep

## Current Blockers
- **Critical**: Stakeholder review of validation findings - all development blocked until complete
- **High**: User research authorization needed - no development should begin without user validation
- **Medium**: Cannabis compliance scope decision - impacts 40-60% of planned development effort

## Immediate Priorities
1. **Stakeholder Review** - Complete review of all validation documents and provide feedback
2. **Scope Decision** - Approve simplified vs. complex scope based on validation findings
3. **User Research Planning** - Authorize interviews with Unity Landing maintainers
4. **Technical Audit Planning** - Authorize Unity Landing codebase analysis

## Stakeholder Actions Required
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Review all documents in `/docs/validation/` directory by Aug 07
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Approve/modify project scope based on validation findings by Aug 07  
- [ ] **HIGH**: Authorize user research (3-5 interviews) with Unity maintainers by Aug 06
- [ ] **HIGH**: Provide Unity Landing repository access for technical audit by Aug 06
- [ ] **MEDIUM**: Validate cannabis compliance requirements with legal expert by Aug 10

**Status**: Validation framework complete - awaiting stakeholder input for critical go/no-go decisions
**Risk**: HIGH - Major assumptions require validation before development can proceed safely
**Next Milestone**: Validation Phase Complete (target: Aug 15) - depends on stakeholder responsiveness
