# Product → Project System Handoff Process
**Document Type**: Integration Process (Tier 2 - Project System)  
**Created**: August 19, 2025  
**Purpose**: Define systematic handoff from product strategy to project execution  
**Status**: ACTIVE - Implementation Ready

---

## 🔄 **HANDOFF WORKFLOW**

### **Phase 1: Product Readiness Assessment**
**Trigger**: Product initiative reaches "validated" status in product system

**Readiness Criteria**:
- [ ] Product initiative has completed user research and validation
- [ ] Business value and success criteria clearly defined
- [ ] Market research supports viability (confidence level ≥ 7/10)
- [ ] Technical feasibility assessment completed
- [ ] Resource requirements estimated
- [ ] Stakeholder approval documented

**Deliverables**:
- Approved PRD with acceptance criteria
- Technical architecture outline
- Resource allocation plan
- Success metrics definition

### **Phase 2: Epic Creation & Planning**
**Trigger**: Product initiative approved for development

**Epic Generation Process**:
1. **Epic Decomposition**: Break product initiative into implementable epics
2. **Story Mapping**: Map user journeys and feature relationships
3. **Dependency Analysis**: Identify cross-team and technical dependencies
4. **Effort Estimation**: Initial sizing and timeline estimates
5. **Acceptance Criteria**: Define "definition of done" for each epic

**Required Epic Attributes**:
- Business value statement from product initiative
- Clear acceptance criteria and success metrics
- Target quarter and milestone dates
- Resource requirements and team assignment
- Risk assessment and mitigation plan

### **Phase 3: Feature & Story Creation**
**Trigger**: Epic approved and assigned to development team

**Feature Breakdown Process**:
1. **User Story Creation**: Epic → Features → User Stories progression
2. **RICE/ICE Scoring**: Prioritization using established methodology
3. **Sprint Planning**: Feature assignment to specific sprints
4. **Task Definition**: Technical implementation tasks
5. **Integration Planning**: CI/CD and deployment coordination

**Quality Gates**:
- All features have clear user stories and acceptance criteria
- RICE/ICE scores validated by product and engineering teams
- Dependencies mapped and coordination planned
- Testing and quality assurance plans defined

## 📊 **TRACKING & MEASUREMENT**

### **Handoff Success Metrics**
- **Time to Epic Creation**: < 5 days from product approval
- **Requirement Clarity**: < 10% rework due to unclear requirements
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: 95% approval on epic definitions
- **Development Velocity**: Consistent sprint velocity after handoff

### **Continuous Improvement**
- Weekly handoff review meetings
- Monthly process optimization
- Quarterly stakeholder feedback collection
- Annual process documentation updates

## 🛠️ **TOOL INTEGRATION**

### **Current PM System Enhancement**
Leverage existing `/pm/` directory structure:
- **Epic Registry**: Enhanced with product initiative links
- **Story Registry**: Improved with acceptance criteria tracking
- **Analysis Registry**: Product validation documentation
- **Plans Registry**: Integrated roadmap and timeline management

### **New Integration Points**
- **Product Initiative Tracking**: Links to `/product-system/` documents
- **Automated Epic Generation**: PRD → Epic conversion tools
- **Progress Synchronization**: Real-time status updates
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Automated reporting and notifications
