## 🎯 TASK OVERVIEW

### **Task Description**
Perform thorough self-analysis of project management process requirements and design a working system with standardized templates for Epic > Story > Task hierarchy with analysis and planning capabilities, ensuring database migration readiness and cleanup processes.

### **Objective**
Create a complete, operational PM system that enables systematic work management with proper analysis and planning integration, supporting future migration to database/web service while maintaining clean directory structure.

## ⚠️ RISKS & BLOCKERS

### **Current Blockers**
| Blocker ID | Description | Impact | Resolution Plan | Target Resolution | Owner |
|------------|-------------|--------|-----------------|-------------------|-------|
| None currently | - | - | - | - | - |

### **Identified Risks**
| Risk ID | Description | Probability | Impact | Mitigation | Owner |
|---------|-------------|-------------|--------|------------|-------|
| R001 | Templates too complex for adoption | Medium | High | Start comprehensive, simplify based on usage | Jon |
| R002 | Directory structure becomes unwieldy | Low | Medium | Implement cleanup early in design | Jon |

### **Assumptions**
- File-based system adequate for current project scale - VALIDATED
- Markdown templates will be maintained consistently - NEEDS VALIDATION
- AI integration approach will work as designed - NEEDS TESTING

## 📋 TECHNICAL DETAILS

### **Implementation Approach**
1. Create comprehensive directory structure with clear separation of concerns
2. Design templates with all necessary sections but prepare for simplification
3. Implement registry system for tracking and overview
4. Create working example to validate approach
5. Document AI integration and cleanup processes

### **Technical Requirements**
- **Directory Structure**: pm/ with epics/, stories/, tasks/, analysis/, plans/, templates/, registry/
- **Template Completeness**: All PM artifacts covered with consistent structure
- **Registry System**: Master tracking files with current status and relationships
- **Database Readiness**: Consistent IDs, relationships, and data structure

### **Key Components/Files**
- **Templates**: Epic/Story/Task/Analysis/Plan templates - COMPLETE
- **Registry Files**: Epic/Story/Task registries + active work - COMPLETE
- **Directory Structure**: Full pm/ hierarchy - COMPLETE
- **Working Example**: E001/S001/T001 set - IN PROGRESS

### **Technology/Tools Used**
- Markdown: Template and artifact creation
- File System: Directory structure and organization
- Git: Version control and change tracking
- Documentation: README files for usage instructions

## 🧪 TESTING & VALIDATION

### **Testing Approach**
Create real Epic/Story/Task using the templates to validate completeness, usability, and workflow effectiveness while documenting any issues or improvements needed.

### **Test Cases**
| Test Case | Input | Expected Output | Status |
|-----------|-------|-----------------|--------|
| TC001 | Create Epic using template | Complete E001 Epic artifact | PASS |
| TC002 | Create Story using template | Complete S001 Story artifact | PASS |
| TC003 | Create Task using template | Complete T001 Task artifact | IN PROGRESS |
| TC004 | Update registries | Accurate tracking of all work items | IN PROGRESS |

### **Validation Steps**
1. Create directory structure and verify organization
2. Create all templates and verify completeness
3. Create working Epic/Story/Task example
4. Test registry system with real work items
5. Document AI integration approach
6. Define cleanup processes

## 📝 TASK NOTES

### **Implementation Notes**
- Templates are comprehensive but may need simplification based on real usage
- Registry system provides good overview but needs testing with more work items
- Directory structure clean and organized, ready for growth
- Working example validates the approach effectively

### **Decisions Made**
- **2025-08-04**: Three-tier hierarchy (Epic > Story > Task) chosen for clarity
- **2025-08-04**: Separate analysis/plan files for focused thinking vs inline sections
- **2025-08-04**: File-based system for immediate implementation, database readiness built in

### **Issues Encountered**
- **2025-08-04**: Template complexity concern - comprehensive vs usable balance needed
- **2025-08-04**: Registry maintenance - need to ensure consistent updates

### **Lessons Learned**
- Comprehensive templates better than minimal for initial design - can simplify later
- Registry system essential for project overview and progress tracking
- Working example critical for validating template design decisions
- AI integration approach must be documented clearly for adoption

### **Resources Used**
- Project management best practices: Effective for template structure design
- Know-base-mcp project context: Essential for understanding real PM needs
