**Task ID**: T002  
**Story ID**: S001  
**Task Name**: PM System Cleanup Process  
**Created**: 2025-08-04  
**Owner**: Jon  
**Status**: NOT_STARTED  
**Priority**: MEDIUM

**Start Date**: TBD  
**Target End Date**: 2025-08-06  
**Actual End Date**: TBD

## üéØ TASK OVERVIEW

### **Task Description**
Define and implement cleanup processes for the PM system to prevent directory clutter, maintain system hygiene, and ensure long-term maintainability while preserving important project artifacts and decision history.

### **Objective**
Create systematic cleanup procedures that automatically archive completed work, remove outdated artifacts, and maintain clean directory structure without losing valuable project information or decision context.

### **Context**
As the PM system grows with project work, directories will accumulate many files. Without cleanup processes, the system becomes unwieldy and hard to navigate, reducing its effectiveness and adoption.

## ‚úÖ ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

### **Completion Criteria**
- [ ] **Cleanup task template** created for recurring maintenance work
- [ ] **Archiving procedures** defined for completed Epics/Stories/Tasks
- [ ] **Retention policies** established for different artifact types
- [ ] **Automated cleanup scripts** (optional) or manual procedures documented
- [ ] **Cleanup schedule** defined (monthly, quarterly, or trigger-based)

### **Quality Gates**
- [ ] **Process Review**: Cleanup procedures tested with sample artifacts
- [ ] **Safety Review**: Important information preserved during cleanup
- [ ] **Documentation Review**: Clear cleanup instructions for future use
- [ ] **Stakeholder Review**: Jon approval of cleanup approach and schedule

### **Definition of Done**
- [ ] Cleanup procedures documented and tested
- [ ] Archive structure created for completed work
- [ ] First cleanup executed successfully
- [ ] Cleanup integrated into PM workflow
- [ ] Long-term maintenance approach established

## üîó RELATIONSHIPS & DEPENDENCIES

### **Task Dependencies**
- **Depends On**: T001 (PM Requirements Analysis) - need main system operational first
- **Blocks**: None - enhancement to existing system

### **Story Relationship**
- **Parent Story**: S001 - Create PM Capabilities for MCP Server
- **Story Context**: Essential maintenance capability to keep PM system usable long-term

### **Resource Dependencies**
- **People**: Jon (cleanup process design and execution)
- **Tools**: File system operations, archiving tools
- **Information**: Completed T001 analysis of what artifacts are generated
- **External**: None - internal process optimization

## ‚ö†Ô∏è RISKS & BLOCKERS

### **Current Blockers**
| Blocker ID | Description | Impact | Resolution Plan | Target Resolution | Owner |
|------------|-------------|--------|-----------------|-------------------|-------|
| B001 | T001 not complete | Medium | Cannot design cleanup until main system operational | T001 completion | Jon |

### **Identified Risks**
| Risk ID | Description | Probability | Impact | Mitigation | Owner |
|---------|-------------|-------------|--------|------------|-------|
| R001 | Accidental deletion of important artifacts | Low | High | Conservative archiving, clear procedures | Jon |
| R002 | Cleanup process not followed consistently | Medium | Medium | Simple procedures, integrate with PM workflow | Jon |

### **Assumptions**
- Completed work can be safely archived after 30 days - NEEDS VALIDATION
- Archive structure will be sufficient for future reference - NEEDS VALIDATION
- Manual cleanup procedures adequate vs automated tools - NEEDS VALIDATION

## üìã TECHNICAL DETAILS

### **Implementation Approach**
1. Analyze T001 results to understand artifact types and lifecycle
2. Design archive directory structure for completed work
3. Define cleanup procedures for different completion states
4. Create cleanup task template for recurring maintenance
5. Test cleanup process with sample artifacts
6. Document procedures and integrate with PM workflow

### **Technical Requirements**
- **Archive Structure**: pm/archive/ with date-based organization
- **Cleanup Procedures**: Step-by-step instructions for different scenarios
- **Safety Measures**: Backup and verification before deletion
- **Integration**: Cleanup tasks trackable in PM system

### **Key Components/Files**
- **Archive Directory**: pm/archive/YYYY-MM/ structure for completed work
- **Cleanup Template**: Recurring task template for maintenance
- **Cleanup Procedures**: Documentation for safe archiving process
- **Retention Policy**: Guidelines for what to keep vs archive

### **Technology/Tools Used**
- File System: Directory operations and organization
- Git: Version control preserves history even after cleanup
- Documentation: Clear procedures for consistent execution

## üß™ TESTING & VALIDATION

### **Testing Approach**
Create sample completed Epic/Story/Task set and test cleanup procedures to ensure important information preserved while directory structure remains clean and navigable.

### **Test Cases**
| Test Case | Input | Expected Output | Status |
|-----------|-------|-----------------|--------|
| TC001 | Completed Epic cleanup | Epic archived, directory clean | PENDING |
| TC002 | Completed Story cleanup | Story archived, links preserved | PENDING |
| TC003 | Completed Task cleanup | Task archived, history maintained | PENDING |

### **Validation Steps**
1. Create archive directory structure
2. Define cleanup procedures
3. Test with sample artifacts
4. Verify information preservation
5. Document final procedures
6. Integrate with PM workflow

## üìä PROGRESS TRACKING

### **Current Progress**: 0% complete

### **Work Breakdown**
- [ ] **Archive Design**: Create pm/archive/ structure and organization - PENDING
- [ ] **Cleanup Procedures**: Define step-by-step archiving process - PENDING
- [ ] **Template Creation**: Cleanup task template for recurring work - PENDING
- [ ] **Testing**: Validate procedures with sample artifacts - PENDING
- [ ] **Documentation**: Usage instructions and integration - PENDING
- [ ] **Integration**: Connect with main PM workflow - PENDING

### **Time Log**
| Date | Hours | Work Performed | Notes |
|------|-------|----------------|-------|
| Not started | - | - | Waiting for T001 completion |

### **Next Actions**
1. Wait for T001 completion and review - Target: T001 completion
2. Design archive structure based on T001 findings - Target: Day after T001
3. Create cleanup procedures and test with samples - Target: 1 day after start

## üìù TASK NOTES

### **Implementation Notes**
- Will be designed based on T001 findings about artifact types and usage patterns
- Archive structure should preserve project history while enabling clean current workspace
- Cleanup procedures must be simple enough to follow consistently

### **Decisions Made**
- None yet - waiting for T001 completion to inform design decisions

### **Issues Encountered**
- None yet - task not started

### **Lessons Learned**
- Cleanup design should follow main system implementation for informed decisions

### **Resources Used**
- Will leverage T001 analysis when available

## üîÑ REVIEW & HANDOFF

### **Review Requirements**
- **Process Review**: REQUIRED - cleanup procedures must be safe and effective
- **Stakeholder Review**: REQUIRED - Jon approval of cleanup approach

### **Handoff Items**
- Cleanup procedures ready for recurring use - Handoff to ongoing PM maintenance
- Archive structure established - Handoff to project team

### **Documentation Updates**
- PM README.md: Add cleanup procedures section
- CLAUDE.md: Include cleanup tasks in AI session workflow
- Templates: Cleanup task template available for future use
