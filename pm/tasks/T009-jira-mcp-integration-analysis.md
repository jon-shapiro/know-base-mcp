**Task ID**: T009-jira-mcp-integration-analysis  
**Epic**: E001-foundation-validation  
**Story**: S004-pm-system-integration  
**Created**: August 04, 2025  
**Status**: READY  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours  

## Task Purpose
Analyze Jira MCP integration vs local PM system for professional work item tracking and stakeholder visibility.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] **Clear recommendation** with pros/cons analysis of Jira MCP vs local system
- [ ] **Implementation plan** for chosen approach with timeline and effort estimates
- [ ] **Migration strategy** if Jira integration is recommended
- [ ] **Tool compatibility** analysis with current documentation workflow

## Task Context
**Why This Matters**: Current PM system uses local files which may not provide adequate stakeholder visibility or professional work tracking. Jira MCP could provide industry-standard work item management while maintaining document integration.

**Strategic Value**: Professional work item tracking enables better stakeholder communication and project management visibility for cannabis documentation project.

**Dependencies**: 
- T008-initiation-testing completion
- Stakeholder input on tool preferences
- Understanding of Jira MCP capabilities and limitations

## Analysis Requirements

### **Option A: Jira MCP + Local Docs**
**Analyze**:
- Jira MCP integration capabilities with Claude
- Work item sync between Jira and local documentation
- Stakeholder visibility and reporting capabilities
- Complexity of maintaining dual systems
- Cost/effort of Jira setup and maintenance

### **Option B: Enhanced Local System**
**Analyze**:
- Current local PM system strengths and limitations
- Enhancements needed for professional tracking
- Stakeholder visibility options with local system
- Simplicity benefits of single-system approach
- Export/reporting capabilities for stakeholder communication

### **Option C: Jira + Confluence Integration**
**Analyze**:
- Full Atlassian integration for work items + documentation
- Professional stakeholder experience with industry tools
- Complexity of multi-system integration and maintenance
- Migration effort from current local documentation
- Long-term scalability and professional presentation

## Deliverables
1. **Comparison matrix** of all three options with scoring
2. **Recommendation** with clear rationale and strategic alignment
3. **Implementation plan** with timeline, effort, and resource requirements
4. **Migration strategy** if system change is recommended
5. **Stakeholder presentation** materials for decision input

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Comprehensive analysis** covers all three options thoroughly
- [ ] **Strategic alignment** with cannabis documentation project goals
- [ ] **Practical implementation** plan with realistic timelines
- [ ] **Stakeholder consideration** of tool preferences and visibility needs
