# Task: File Inventory Review with Enhanced Context

**Task ID**: T009  
**Story ID**: S001  
**Task Name**: File Inventory Review with Enhanced Context  
**Created**: 2025-08-06  
**Owner**: Jon  
**Status**: NOT_STARTED  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Effort Estimate**: 3 hours  
**Start Date**: 2025-08-06  
**Target End Date**: 2025-08-06  

## üéØ TASK OVERVIEW

### **Task Description**
Review existing file inventory and add enhanced context annotations with decisions on how files should be used in the process testing approach. Focus on clarifying which files support the end-to-end workflow testing (components ‚Üí liquid conversion ‚Üí ASCII mockup conversion) vs. which are over-engineered assumptions.

### **Objective**
Create annotated file inventory that clearly identifies:
- Files that support process testing workflow
- Files that need validation through actual conversion work
- Files that should be archived as over-engineered
- Missing files needed for MCP construct design

### **Context**
**Strategic Clarification**: Components are process testing tools, not scope decisions. Repository separation into three systems planned: know-docs (PM), know-base-mcp (guide generator), jmp-content (runtime output). Need to identify which existing files support the actual workflow: create/tweak components ‚Üí convert existing liquid ‚Üí convert ASCII mockups ‚Üí prove process ‚Üí refine requirements ‚Üí design MCP construct.

**Key Decisions Integrated in This Task**:
- **Components Understanding**: Components are process testing tools to validate end-to-end workflow, not scope selection decisions
- **Repository Organization**: Three-system architecture (know-docs PM system, know-base-mcp cannabis guide generator, jmp-content runtime output) with structured separation approach
- **Separation Plan**: Wait for file system review + design completion before creating clean repositories with only relevant files
- **Industry Architecture**: Product-specific customization (cannabis/jmp/) with company context, not plugin system
- **jmp-content Integration**: Generic format for easy integration into any landing page framework (like know-docs/docs-copy/src structure)
- **Decision Management**: Store decisions in task artifacts rather than separate registry system

**Organization Requirements**:
- Logically organize current directory for easy migration to new clean repositories
- Industry architecture: product-specific with company context (cannabis/jmp/)
- jmp-content compatibility: generic enough for any landing page integration
- Decision integration: Store decisions in task artifacts, eliminate separate decision files

## ‚úÖ ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

### **Enhanced Annotations Required**

- [ ] **Usage Decisions**: Specific decisions on how each file should be used or archived
- [ ] **Missing File Identification**: Gaps in current inventory for process testing needs
- [ ] **Priority Classification**: Critical vs. supporting vs. archive priority levels

### **Context Enhancement**
- [ ] **Workflow Mapping**: How each file supports component creation/conversion testing
- [ ] **MCP Integration**: Which files inform MCP construct design vs. implementation
- [ ] **Requirements Refinement**: Which files need validation through actual process testing
- [ ] **Decision Documentation**: Integration with decisions/clarifications system

### **Quality Gates**
- [ ] **Accuracy Review**: All file purposes based on actual content, not assumptions
- [ ] **Workflow Coverage**: Complete coverage of process testing requirements
- [ ] **Archive Identification**: Clear separation of useful vs. over-engineered content
- [ ] **Implementation Ready**: Next actions clear for each file category

## üîó RELATIONSHIPS & DEPENDENCIES

### **Task Dependencies**
- **Depends On**: D001 (Components as Process Testing clarification)
- **Blocks**: MCP construct design - needs file inventory clarity
- **Blocks**: Requirements refinement - needs process testing file identification

### **Story Relationship**
- **Parent Story**: S001 - Create PM Capabilities
- **Context**: Critical foundation task that enables systematic file management for process testing

### **Information Dependencies**
- **Decision D001**: Components as process testing tools understanding
- **Current File Inventory**: Base inventory for enhancement
- **Process Understanding**: End-to-end workflow for annotation context

## üìã TECHNICAL APPROACH

### **File Review Process**
1. **Read each file** in current inventory
2. **Annotate with process role**: How it supports component testing workflow
3. **Validate content accuracy**: Real vs. assumed vs. hallucinated
4. **Make usage decisions**: Use, validate, or archive
5. **Identify gaps**: Missing files for process testing
6. **Document decisions**: Integration with decisions/clarifications system

### **Annotation Framework**
- **Process Role**: Creation, conversion, testing, design, archive
- **Validation Level**: Validated, needs validation, suspect
- **Usage Decision**: Use as-is, validate first, modify, archive
- **Priority**: Critical, supporting, reference, archive
- **Dependencies**: What other files this depends on or blocks

### **Enhanced Context Categories**
- **Component Creation**: Files supporting component development/tweaking
- **Liquid Conversion**: Files for existing liquid ‚Üí modular structure conversion
- **ASCII Conversion**: Files for mockup ‚Üí liquid component transformation
- **Process Testing**: Files for proving out the end-to-end workflow
- **MCP Design**: Files informing MCP construct design decisions
- **Requirements**: Files for requirements refinement based on testing

## üìä EXPECTED OUTCOMES

### **File Categories After Review**
- **Process Testing Core**: Files directly supporting workflow testing (estimated 8-12 files)
- **MCP Design Foundation**: Files informing construct design (estimated 5-8 files)  
- **Validation Targets**: Files needing validation through process testing (estimated 10-15 files)
- **Archive Candidates**: Over-engineered or hallucinated content (estimated 8-12 files)
- **Missing Files**: Gaps to create for complete process testing (estimated 3-5 files)

### **Next Actions Clear**
After this task, next actions will be clear for:
- Which files to use for MCP construct design
- Which files to validate through actual conversion work
- Which files to archive to prevent confusion
- What new files to create for complete workflow support

## ‚ö†Ô∏è RISKS & ISSUES

### **Task Risks**
| Risk ID | Description | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|---------|-------------|-------------|--------|------------|
| R001 | File content doesn't match assumptions | High | Medium | Read all files carefully |
| R002 | Missing critical process files | Medium | High | Identify gaps systematically |
| R003 | Over-complex annotation system | Low | Low | Keep annotations practical |

### **Dependencies**
- **Information**: Need access to all source repositories for validation
- **Decisions**: Integration with decisions/clarifications documentation system
- **Process**: Understanding of complete workflow from components to MCP construct

## üìù TASK NOTES

### **Strategic Context**
This task is critical because current file inventory may contain over-engineered assumptions that don't support the actual process testing workflow. Enhanced annotations will enable systematic approach to proving out the component conversion process.

### **Quality Standards**
- All annotations based on actual file content, not assumptions
- Clear usage decisions for every file
- Systematic identification of process testing gaps
- Integration with decision documentation for future reference
