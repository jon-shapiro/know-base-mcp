# Task: Document Consolidation Planning

**Task ID**: T010  
**Story ID**: S001  
**Task Name**: Document Consolidation Planning  
**Created**: 2025-08-06 (RETROACTIVE - Fixing process failure)  
**Owner**: Jon  
**Status**: COMPLETE  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Effort Estimate**: 4 hours  
**Start Date**: 2025-08-06  
**Target End Date**: 2025-08-06  

## üéØ TASK OVERVIEW

### **Task Description**
Create comprehensive plan for consolidating overlapping documents across repositories and organizing target repository structure for clean migration.

### **Objective**
Document systematic consolidation strategy eliminating overlap and ensuring complete coverage before build phase migration.

### **Context**
**Process Failure Corrected**: This task was created retroactively to fix process violation where P008-document-consolidation-plan.md was created without proper task linkage.

## ‚úÖ ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA (COMPLETED)

### **Document Overlap Analysis**
- [x] Identify all overlapping documents across repositories
- [x] Map consolidation strategies for each overlap
- [x] Document merge vs. extract vs. create decisions
- [x] Validate source document quality and completeness

### **Target Repository Structure**
- [x] Define complete directory structure for know-docs migration
- [x] Specify consolidation actions for each document type
- [x] Map source locations to target locations
- [x] Identify missing documents requiring creation

### **Migration Planning**
- [x] Document bulk migration strategy
- [x] Identify manual consolidation work required
- [x] Estimate effort for document creation and merging
- [x] Plan validation process for consolidated documents

## üîó RELATIONSHIPS & DEPENDENCIES

### **Task Dependencies**
- **Triggered By**: Repository separation planning (P001)
- **Enables**: Clean migration to know-docs repository
- **Blocks**: Requirements phase start until consolidation complete

### **Story Relationship**
- **Parent Story**: S001 - Create PM Capabilities
- **Context**: Organization planning for clean repository structure

### **Process Dependencies**
- **File Creation Process**: Violated then corrected with T011
- **Registry Systems**: Updated retroactively to include this task
- **Repository Separation**: P001 plan implementation requires this consolidation

## üìã TECHNICAL APPROACH (COMPLETED)

### **Overlap Analysis Method**
1. **Document Inventory**: Catalog all documents across repositories
2. **Content Analysis**: Identify overlapping topics and approaches
3. **Quality Assessment**: Determine best source for each topic area
4. **Consolidation Strategy**: Define merge/extract/create actions
5. **Gap Identification**: Find missing required documents

### **Target Structure Design**
- **Hierarchical Organization**: Clear category separation
- **Migration Action Mapping**: Each document type has clear action
- **Gap Documentation**: Missing documents identified with effort estimates
- **Quality Standards**: 8+/10 minimum for all consolidated content

## üìä OUTCOMES ACHIEVED

### **Document Consolidation Strategy**
- **5 Critical Overlaps**: Identified and mapped consolidation approach
- **30 Hours Effort**: Estimated for complete consolidation work
- **Target Structure**: Complete know-docs repository organization
- **Migration Actions**: [MERGE], [MIGRATE], [CREATE], [EXTRACT] documented

### **Gap Analysis Results**
- **Component Specs**: 13 of 16 missing specifications identified
- **Architecture Documents**: 4 missing technical specifications
- **User Scenarios**: Additional JMP scenarios found in know-docs
- **Quality Standards**: Complete creation requirements documented

## ‚ö†Ô∏è PROCESS FAILURE DOCUMENTATION

### **Failure Details**
- **Violation**: Created P008 without corresponding task
- **Discovery**: Found during T011 process failure audit
- **Impact**: Document not tracked in registries, violated file creation process
- **Correction**: Created T010 retroactively, updated all registries

### **Prevention Applied**
- **T011 Created**: Systematic process failure correction task
- **Registry Updates**: All registries updated to include T010
- **Process Strengthening**: Enhanced file creation validation
