# Systematic Plan: Stakeholder Decisions Required
**Priority**: Immediate stakeholder input needed on 5 key decisions  
**Timeline**: Approval needed to proceed with Session 21

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **RECOMMENDATION 1: CREATE EPIC 19 - CONTEXT & PROCESS MANAGEMENT**

**Problem**: System will fail from context overload and process failures within 20-30 sessions  
**Solution**: New dedicated epic for system sustainability  
**Business Impact**: Prevents system collapse, enables scaling

**Approval Needed**: âœ… Create Epic 19 with 7 critical features

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **RECOMMENDATION 2: EXECUTE T009 IMMEDIATELY** 

**Problem**: No actual file inventory exists despite claims  
**Solution**: Execute T009 file inventory with process testing context  
**Business Impact**: Foundation for repository migration and MCP design

**Approval Needed**: âœ… Execute T009 as next session priority

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **RECOMMENDATION 3: GROOM 86 FEATURES (Archive ~30)**

**Problem**: 30-40% of features are duplicates/over-engineered  
**Solution**: Systematic feature audit and consolidation  
**Business Impact**: Cleaner backlog, focused development effort

**Approval Needed**: âœ… Approve feature grooming with ~30 feature archival

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **RECOMMENDATION 4: IMPLEMENT REGISTRY LOADING STRATEGY**

**Problem**: Context will become too large for Claude as system grows  
**Solution**: Phase-based smart loading (inception/development/enhancement)  
**Business Impact**: System remains usable as it scales

**Approval Needed**: âœ… Implement smart context loading approach

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **RECOMMENDATION 5: ESTABLISH PROJECT INCEPTION PROCESS**

**Problem**: No clear criteria for when new projects get dedicated repositories  
**Solution**: Review gate process: inception in know-pm â†’ migration to dedicated repo  
**Business Impact**: Clear project boundaries, proper resource allocation

**Approval Needed**: âœ… Approve project inception to migration workflow

---

## ðŸ“‹ **STAKEHOLDER DECISIONS REQUIRED**

1. **Epic 19 Creation**: Approve new epic for system sustainability? (YES/NO)
2. **T009 Priority**: Execute file inventory as Session 21 priority? (YES/NO)  
3. **Feature Grooming**: Archive ~30 problematic features? (YES/NO)
4. **Context Loading**: Implement smart loading to prevent overload? (YES/NO)
5. **Project Process**: Establish inception-to-migration workflow? (YES/NO)

**Default Recommendation**: YES to all 5 decisions - system sustainability requires all components

---

## ðŸš€ **EXECUTION SEQUENCE (Upon Approval)**

**Session 21**: Execute T009 + Create Epic 19 + Begin feature grooming  
**Session 22**: Implement registry loading strategy + Project inception process  
**Session 23**: Complete feature grooming + Context scaling solution

**Timeline**: 3 sessions to implement complete system sustainability framework  
**Risk if Delayed**: System becomes unusable within 20-30 sessions due to context overload
